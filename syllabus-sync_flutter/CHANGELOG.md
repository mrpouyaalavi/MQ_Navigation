## [Unreleased]

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Phase 2 + Phase 3 Delivery

**Scope:** Implement the migration blueprint’s mobile auth/profile/settings stack and home/calendar core inside the Flutter client.

**Summary:**
Replaced the placeholder Phase 2 experience with production-backed routes and screens for login, signup, email verification, password reset, MFA challenge/enrollment, onboarding, profile editing, and settings management. Added Supabase-backed repositories and Riverpod controllers for auth, profile, user preferences, and MFA state. Wired app-level theme, locale, and biometric lock behavior into `MaterialApp.router` and routing guards.

Replaced the placeholder Phase 3 experience with a repository-backed dashboard and calendar. Added shared academic models for units, deadlines, events, todos, gamification, dashboard stress metrics, and calendar entries. Implemented agenda/day/week calendar views, unit filters, quick-add/edit/delete sheets for deadlines, exams, events, and todos, plus dashboard cards for deadlines, events, units, XP, streaks, and workload pressure.

**Files changed:**
- `lib/app/router/app_router.dart` and `lib/app/router/route_guard.dart` — Added Phase 2 routes and multi-step auth/onboarding/MFA recovery guards

### Raouf: 2026-03-10 (AEDT) — Context7 Docs Compliance Fixes

**Scope:** Compare codebase against latest 2026 Flutter/Riverpod/GoRouter/Supabase/local_auth docs via Context7; fix deviations.

**Summary:**
Fetched latest documentation for Flutter, Riverpod 3, GoRouter 17, Supabase Flutter, and local_auth 3 via Context7 MCP. Compared all patterns against our code. Found 3 deviations from the Flutter error handling docs: missing `PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError` (Layer 2 error catcher), missing `ErrorWidget.builder` customisation in MaterialApp, and missing `FlutterError.presentError` call for debug console output. All other patterns (ColorScheme.fromSeed, NavigationBar, AsyncNotifier, ref.listen/read/watch, refreshListenable, StatefulShellRoute, PKCE auth, onAuthStateChange, biometric API) confirmed correct.

**Files changed:**
- `lib/core/error/error_boundary.dart` — Added `PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError` (Layer 2) + `FlutterError.presentError` call
- `lib/app/syllabus_sync_app.dart` — Added `MaterialApp.builder` with custom `ErrorWidget.builder`

**Verification:**
- `flutter analyze` -> No issues found
- `flutter test` -> 78/78 tests passed
- 12/12 patterns confirmed matching latest 2026 docs

### Raouf: 2026-03-10 (AEDT) — Production-Grade Audit & Polish

**Scope:** Comprehensive audit fixing critical bugs, adding professional docs, hardening configs.

**Summary:**
Full production-grade audit identified and fixed 14 code issues: EnvConfig.validate() now throws StateError in release builds (was assert-only, invisible in production); GoRouter rebuilt to use a single stable instance with AuthRefreshNotifier/refreshListenable pattern (was recreating on every auth state change, destroying navigator); ErrorBoundary now mounted in widget tree; debugLogDiagnostics gated behind isDevelopment; ConnectivityService performs initial check on construction; MFA check logs errors instead of silent catch; biometric service removed deprecated param; nav bar labels localised; login page uses MqInput; Building entity has ==/hashCode; MqTheme switched from dead BottomNavigationBarTheme to NavigationBarTheme; Result<T> unsafe getters removed; splash magic numbers replaced with tokens; pubspec pinned all `any` deps.

Added full professional documentation suite: README.md, LICENSE (MIT), CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md. Hardened analysis_options.yaml with 20+ lint rules. Added .editorconfig, .vscode/settings.json, .vscode/extensions.json.
