# Syllabus Sync - Flutter Mobile App

A cross-platform mobile client for Macquarie University's campus management platform, built with Flutter. Part of a **two frontends, one backend** architecture sharing a Supabase backend with the existing [Next.js web application](https://github.com/Raoof128/Pouya-Raouf-COMP3130).

## Features

- **Dashboard** -- upcoming deadlines, today's schedule, recent events, study streaks
- **Calendar** -- academic calendar with deadline and exam tracking
- **Campus Map** -- interactive Google Maps with 100+ building entries, search, and routing
- **Events Feed** -- university events with filtering and bookmarking
- **Settings** -- profile management, theme preferences, notification controls
- **35-Language Support** -- full i18n with RTL support (Arabic, Farsi, Hebrew, Urdu)
- **Dark Mode** -- system-aware light and dark themes using MQ design tokens
- **Biometric Auth** -- optional fingerprint/face authentication for sensitive actions
- **Offline Awareness** -- connectivity monitoring with graceful degradation

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | Flutter 3.11+ (Dart 3.11+) |
| State Management | Riverpod 3.2 |
| Routing | GoRouter 17.1 (StatefulShellRoute, auth guards) |
| Backend | Supabase (Auth, Postgres, RLS, Realtime, Edge Functions) |
| Maps | Google Maps Flutter 2.14 |
| Security | flutter_secure_storage, local_auth |
| Push Notifications | Firebase Cloud Messaging |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions (analyze, test, build Android + iOS) |
| Localisation | Flutter ARB (35 locales, 1,995 keys each) |

## Architecture

Feature-first clean architecture with three layers per module:

```
lib/
  app/          # Bootstrap, router, theme, l10n
  core/         # Config, error handling, logging, security, networking
  shared/       # Design system widgets, providers, extensions
  features/     # auth, home, calendar, map, feed, settings, ...
    <feature>/
      data/           # Data sources + repositories
      domain/         # Entities, value objects, interfaces
      presentation/   # Pages, widgets, controllers
```

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full architecture overview.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) ^3.11.0 (stable channel)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for platform builds
- A Supabase project (shared with the web app)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Raoof128/Pouya-Raouf-COMP3130.git
cd Pouya-Raouf-COMP3130/syllabus-sync_flutter

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Generate localisation files
flutter gen-l10n

# Run the app (development mode)
flutter run \
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co \
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key \
  --dart-define=GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-maps-key \
  --dart-define=APP_ENV=development
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Yes | Supabase project URL |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Yes | Supabase anonymous API key |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | No | Google Maps SDK key (needed for map feature) |
| `APP_ENV` | No | `development` (default), `staging`, or `production` |

## Development

### Quality Checks

Run the full check suite (mirrors the web app's `npm run check`):

```bash
# Full check (includes debug APK build)
./scripts/check.sh

# Quick check (skips build step)
./scripts/check.sh --quick
```

This executes: `pub get` -> `format check` -> `analyze` -> `test` -> `gen-l10n` -> `build`

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
flutter test

# With coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Specific test file
flutter test test/features/map/building_test.dart
```

**78 tests** across 8 test suites covering theme tokens, core utilities, domain entities, and shared widgets.

### Project Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/check.sh` | Full quality gate (format, analyze, test, l10n, build) |
| `scripts/check.sh --quick` | Quality gate without build step |
| `tools/convert_i18n.dart` | Convert web app JSON translations to Flutter ARB format |

## Design System

The MQ Design System maps Macquarie University's brand tokens to Flutter:

| Component | Class | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Colors | `MqColors` | Brand palette (MQ Red, Alabaster, Charcoal, semantic colors) |
| Typography | `MqTypography` | Work Sans + Source Serif Pro type scale |
| Spacing | `MqSpacing` | 4px-base spacing scale, radius tokens, 48dp tap targets |
| Theme | `MqTheme` | Light + dark `ThemeData` builders |
| Button | `MqButton` | Filled, outlined, and text variants with loading state |
| Card | `MqCard` | Themed card with optional tap handler |
| Input | `MqInput` | Text input with validation, prefix/suffix icons |
| App Bar | `MqAppBar` | Standard app bar with MQ styling |
| Bottom Sheet | `MqBottomSheet` | Modal sheet with drag handle |

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions runs on every push and PR to `main`:

1. **Analyze & Test** -- format check, static analysis, 78 unit/widget tests with coverage
2. **Build Android** -- release APK with secrets injection (main branch only)
3. **Build iOS** -- release build without code signing (main branch only)
