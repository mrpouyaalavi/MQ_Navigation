# MQ Navigation Flutter — Agent Rules

## Project Overview
Flutter mobile client for MQ Navigation (Macquarie University campus navigation platform).
Two frontends, one backend architecture: Flutter + Next.js sharing a Supabase backend.

## Architecture
- **Pattern**: Feature-first with data/domain/presentation layers per feature
- **State management**: Riverpod (flutter_riverpod ^3.2.1)
- **Routing**: go_router with StatefulShellRoute for 3-tab bottom nav (Home, Map, Settings)
- **Backend**: Supabase (Postgres, RLS, Realtime, Edge Functions)
- **Theme**: MQ design tokens (MqColors, MqTypography, MqSpacing) mapped from web app
- **i18n**: Flutter ARB files with 35 locales, RTL support for ar/fa/he/ur
- **No auth**: App starts directly at `/home` — no login, signup, or profile management

## Non-Negotiable Constraints
1. Supabase is the system of record — no parallel backend
2. Web app stays alive — no feature freeze on the web product
3. Flutter is a presentation layer only — no server logic in app binary
4. No server secrets in Flutter — API keys stay in Edge Functions
5. Security is non-negotiable — encrypted storage, RLS enforcement
6. Accessibility from day one — 48x48dp tap targets, semantic labels, RTL

## Directory Structure
```
lib/
  app/bootstrap/    → App init, Supabase + Firebase setup
  app/router/       → go_router config, route names
  app/theme/        → MQ design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
  app/l10n/         → ARB files + generated localisations
  core/config/      → Env vars via --dart-define
  core/error/       → App exceptions, error boundary
  core/logging/     → Structured logger
  core/network/     → Connectivity service
  core/security/    → Secure storage
  core/utils/       → Result type, validators
  shared/widgets/   → MQ button, card, input, bottom sheet, app bar
  shared/models/    → UserPreferences
  shared/extensions/→ BuildContext extensions
  features/home/    → Welcome hub
  features/map/     → Campus map (153 buildings, search, routing)
  features/notifications/ → FCM push + local study prompts
  features/settings/ → Theme, locale, notification preferences (local storage)
```

## Key Environment Variables (--dart-define)
- SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY, APP_ENV
- DEV_SUPABASE_URL, DEV_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, DEV_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY (debug-only fallbacks)
- All keys loaded via `--dart-define-from-file=.env` — never hardcoded in source
- Use `scripts/run.sh` to launch with native key injection for Maps SDKs

### Raouf: 2026-04-22 (AEST) — Environment setup
**Scope:** `.env` creation.
**Summary:** Created a `.env` file from `.env.example` template with placeholders for Supabase and Google Maps credentials. This enables usage of `scripts/run.sh` and proper environment configuration.
**Files Changed:** `.env` (new, gitignored)
**Verification:** File exists and matches `.env.example` structure.

### Raouf: 2026-04-30 (AEST) — Bottom tab label updated to Navigation + emulator cleanup
**Scope:** Taskbar section naming and local runtime process hygiene.
**Summary:** Changed only the bottom navigation map tab label to `Navigation` by wiring `AppShell` to `l10n.navigation` instead of `l10n.map`. Kept `Campus Map` strings untouched in map renderer toggle/settings contexts. Executed emulator cleanup commands and verified no Android emulator/qemu processes remained.
**Files Changed:** `lib/app/router/app_shell.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `dart format lib/app/router/app_shell.dart` (no diff); `flutter analyze lib/app/router/app_shell.dart` (no issues); `ps -ax -o pid=,command= | rg "Android Emulator|/emulator/emulator|qemu-system| -avd "` (none running after cleanup).
**Follow-ups:** Optional locale copy pass if you want language-specific wording for `navigation` beyond current translations/fallbacks.

### Raouf: 2026-04-30 (AEST) — Live navigation smooth-follow hardening + runtime diagnostics
**Scope:** Real-device navigation smoothness and live-location observability across map renderers and controller.
**Summary:** Added a navigation follow throttle in both `GoogleMapView` and `DesktopMapFallbackView` to reduce camera jitter from noisy high-frequency location ticks: after initial forced follow, camera updates now require both a minimum 900ms interval and at least 3m movement. This keeps navigation readable without lagging behind real movement. Added controller-level structured diagnostics logs for `startNavigation`, `stopNavigation`, arrival detection, recalculation triggers, and a throttled (5s) navigation diagnostics payload (`accuracyMetres`, `distFromLastFetchMetres`, `distToDestinationMetres`, `isOffRoute`, `routeDistanceMeters`) to support real-device debugging.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/google/google_map_view.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/google/desktop_map_fallback_view.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/controllers/map_controller.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `dart format` on edited files (pass); `flutter analyze lib/features/map` (no issues); `flutter test test/features/map` (71/71 passed); `./scripts/check.sh --quick` (5/5 passed, 155 tests).
**Follow-ups:** Add heading-aware camera bearing/tilt follow once heading quality and reduced-motion gating are finalized.

### Raouf: 2026-04-30 (AEST) — Live navigation/location production audit + stale-state race fix (Context7 aligned)
**Scope:** End-to-end audit of map live navigation and locate-me behavior across controller + renderers, with documentation verification.
**Summary:** Audited the complete live-location/live-navigation pipeline against current Context7 docs for `geolocator`, `google_maps_flutter`, and `flutter_map`. Existing implementation already covered most production patterns (permission checks, platform-specific settings, stream-based updates, explicit camera zoom behavior). Identified one race condition in `MapController.centerOnCurrentLocation`: async permission/location awaits could complete after other user actions and overwrite newer map state because updates were based on a stale pre-await snapshot. Updated the method to re-read `state.value` after awaits and apply changes to the latest state only, preventing selection/route rollback during in-flight locate-me requests. Added regression coverage in `map_controller_test.dart`.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/map/presentation/controllers/map_controller.dart`, `test/features/map/map_controller_test.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `dart format` on edited files (pass); `flutter test test/features/map/map_controller_test.dart` (13/13 passed); `flutter analyze lib/features/map` (no issues); `./scripts/check.sh --quick` (5/5 passed, 155 tests).
**Follow-ups:** Continue using post-await latest-state writes for any new async map state mutations.

### Raouf: 2026-04-30 (AEST) — Ignore Android emulator default mock location for locate-me
**Scope:** `LocationSource.getCurrentLocation` fallback hygiene for Google-map locate-me.
**Summary:** Investigated why pressing locate-me in Google Maps jumped to a building in the US. Root cause: Android emulators without a simulated location can return the default mocked Googleplex coordinate (`37.4219983, -122.084`) from both `getCurrentPosition` and `getLastKnownPosition`. Added a guard that rejects this mocked default fix so locate-me no longer animates to a misleading US coordinate; instead the existing location-unavailable/permission flow is used.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/map/data/datasources/location_source.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `dart format lib/features/map/data/datasources/location_source.dart` (no diff); `flutter analyze lib/features/map` (no issues); `flutter test test/features/map` (70/70 passed).
**Follow-ups:** Set an explicit mock GPS point in Android Emulator Extended Controls when testing locate-me.

### Raouf: 2026-04-30 (AEST) — Locate-me accuracy fix (raw GPS + last-known fallback + honest error banner)
**Scope:** `LocationSource.getCurrentLocation` / `watch`, and `MapController.centerOnCurrentLocation`.
**Summary:** Locate-me was showing a wrong location because `getCurrentLocation` used base `LocationSettings` which on Android dispatches via Play-Services' Fused Location Provider (Wi-Fi triangulation + cached fixes, often hundreds of metres off), and when that timed out the controller silently snapped to the hardcoded campus-centre fallback. Switched to `AndroidSettings(bestForNavigation, forceLocationManager: true, timeLimit: 15s)` to use raw GPS, added `getLastKnownPosition` as a real cached-fix fallback before giving up, and removed the synthetic campus-centre snap so when GPS truly fails the controller now surfaces the proper permission/unavailable banner instead of a fake dot. Same platform-tuned settings applied to the streaming `watch()` so live navigation no longer jitters off the route polyline.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/map/data/datasources/location_source.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/controllers/map_controller.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `dart format` → no diff; `flutter analyze lib/features/map test/features/map` → no issues; `flutter test test/features/map` → 70/70 passed; `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed.
**Follow-ups:** Real-device validation of the new banner path when location services are off / permission denied. Consider an inline "improve accuracy" hint when the last-known fallback is used.

### Raouf: 2026-04-30 (AEST) — maps-routes 500 fix + L10n parity for two stale map keys
**Scope:** Edge Function resilience for Google Routes empty responses + l10n parity restored.
**Summary:** Fixed `maps-routes error 500: "No Google routes were returned"` by retrying Google Routes with WALK when a non-WALK mode returns zero results (handles campus buildings with no drivable snap point), and emitting a structured 404 with `code: 'NO_ROUTE'` when even WALK fails — instead of the previous opaque 500 that crashed `loadRoute`. Added `untranslated-messages-file: /tmp/untranslated.json` to `l10n.yaml`, identified that `mapCategoryLibrary` and `mapOsmFallbackBadge` had been added to `app_en.arb` in earlier sessions but never propagated, and added both keys (English fallback) to all 34 non-English ARB files so `flutter run` no longer warns about untranslated messages.
**Files Changed:** `supabase/functions/maps-routes/index.ts`, `l10n.yaml`, `lib/app/l10n/app_*.arb` (34 non-English locales), regenerated `lib/app/l10n/generated/*`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `deno fmt` + `deno check` on edge function → pass; `supabase functions deploy maps-routes --no-verify-jwt` → success; `flutter gen-l10n` → 0 untranslated; `flutter analyze lib/features/map test/features/map` → no issues; `flutter test test/features/map` → 70/70 passed; `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed.
**Follow-ups:** Read the `NO_ROUTE` `code` field in `MapsRoutesRemoteSource` and surface a dedicated `MapStateError.noRouteExists` so the banner can say "No route between these points" instead of the generic unavailable copy. Translate the two backfilled keys natively in priority locales.

### Raouf: 2026-04-30 (AEST) — Map UX fixes: locate-me, campus zoom restriction, Google live navigation
**Scope:** Three user-reported map regressions across the campus, native Google, and desktop OSM-fallback renderers.
**Summary:** Locate-me on the Google renderer used `animateCamera(newLatLng)` with no zoom, so pressing it while already on the locate-me fallback coordinate was a silent no-op — replaced with `newLatLngZoom(point, 17)` so a press always animates, applied identically to the desktop fallback. Campus map zoom bounds were too permissive (`minZoom: -5`, `maxZoom: 1.5`) — tightened to `minZoom: -4` and a hard `mapMaxZoom = min(meta.maxZoom, 1.0)` so the raster never pixelates and users cannot pinch out into empty space. Google Maps live navigation looked frozen because each tick called `animateCamera(newLatLng)` without zoom and inherited the route-fit zoom (~14) — now snaps to `_navigationFollowZoom = 18` on the first navigation tick and on every subsequent location update, with the same fix mirrored in the desktop fallback.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/google/google_map_view.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/google/desktop_map_fallback_view.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/campus/campus_map_view.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `dart format` → no diff; `flutter analyze lib/features/map test/features/map` → no issues; `flutter test test/features/map` → 70/70 passed.
**Follow-ups:** Add tilt/bearing on navigation ticks once device-heading is wired; consider lowering `mapMaxZoom` further to `0.5` if real-device feedback shows softness.

### Raouf: 2026-04-30 (AEST) — Settings menu file-by-file audit + decorative wiring fixes
**Scope:** End-to-end audit of `lib/features/settings` plus consumers of every persisted preference, with i18n hardening.
**Summary:** Traced every `SettingsController` method and every `UserPreferences` field to a real consumer (no dead preferences). Fixed four real issues: dev-diagnostics easter-egg now shows actual app version + active renderer label + Supabase edge proxy host instead of static labels; entire Open Day section migrated from hardcoded English to new `openDay_*` ARB keys propagated to all 35 locales; `_selectTime` no longer crashes on corrupted persisted `HH:mm` strings (uses `tryParse` + bounds-checked midday fallback); `_CommutePreviewTile` now displays the human-readable `favoriteStopName` when available instead of always `#stopId`.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`, `lib/app/l10n/app_en.arb`, `lib/app/l10n/app_*.arb` (34 non-English locales), regenerated `lib/app/l10n/generated/*`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `dart format` → no changes; `flutter analyze lib/features/settings test/features/settings` → no issues; `flutter gen-l10n` → 0 untranslated; `flutter test test/features/settings test/features/map` → 80/80 passed; `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed.
**Follow-ups:** Add `package_info_plus` as a direct dependency so the dev-diagnostics version reads from `PackageInfo.fromPlatform()` instead of the hardcoded `'1.0.0'` literal; consider auto-clearing route/direction/stop fields when `commuteMode` changes across disjoint modes.

### Raouf: 2026-04-30 (AEST) — Map menu full file-by-file audit + decorative wiring fixes
**Scope:** Production-readiness audit of `lib/features/map` (controller, repository, data sources, both renderers, desktop fallback, all overlay/marker/route/location layers, routing panel, search sheet, overlay picker, shared helpers).
**Summary:** Traced every `MapController` public method to a UI call site and confirmed wiring for selectBuilding/selectMeetPoint/loadRoute/centerOnCurrentLocation/setTravelMode/setRenderer/clearRoute/clearSelection/startNavigation/stopNavigation/toggleOverlay/dismissArrival/openStreetView/openInGoogleMaps/openLocationSettings/openAppSettings. Fixed five issues: (1) `clearOverlays` had no caller — wired to a new "Clear All" `TextButton.icon` in `OverlayPickerSheet`'s title row, only rendered when at least one overlay is active, using existing `l10n.clearAll`; (2) the desktop OSM fallback opened on a slightly drifted coordinate while campus + native Google opened on `(-33.77388, 151.11275)` — now all three renderers open on the same official 18 Wally's Walk entrance; (3) collapsed a no-op `initialZoom: isValidBounds ? -3 : -3` ternary in `campus_map_view.dart`; (4) `MapsRoutesRemoteSource` now wraps both error-branch and success-branch `jsonDecode` calls so a non-JSON gateway response surfaces as a meaningful `StateError` instead of an opaque `FormatException`; (5) `_CategoryBuildingList` header now goes through a guarded `_capitalize(searchQuery.trim())` helper instead of unsafe `searchQuery[0].toUpperCase()`.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/google/desktop_map_fallback_view.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/campus/campus_map_view.dart`, `lib/features/map/data/datasources/maps_routes_remote_source.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/pages/map_page.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/overlay_picker_sheet.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `dart format` → no changes; `flutter analyze lib/features/map test/features/map` → no issues; `flutter test test/features/map` → 70/70 passed (incl. 5 `MapsRoutesRemoteSource` HTTP error-path tests).
**Follow-ups:** Extract the campus fallback coordinate `(-33.77388, 151.11275)` to a single shared constant in `core/config` so future renderer additions cannot drift again.

### Raouf: 2026-04-28 (AEST) — Campus map routing panel functional parity audit
**Scope:** Map screen functional parity between campus and google renderers.
**Summary:** Completed a campus-map-first functionality audit and removed the orientation-only campus destination panel that made key actions feel decorative in campus mode. Wired selected-building state in campus mode to the shared `RoutePanel` so route loading, travel mode switching, step-by-step navigation controls, and map handoff actions work directly on the campus renderer.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/map/presentation/pages/map_page.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
**Verification:** `dart format lib/features/map/presentation/pages/map_page.dart`; `flutter analyze lib/features/map/presentation/pages/map_page.dart` (no issues); `flutter test test/features/map/map_controller_test.dart` (9/9 passed); `ReadLints` on edited map page (no linter errors).
**Follow-ups:** Continue map audit by localizing remaining hardcoded category-chip labels in `MapPage` for strict i18n compliance.

### Raouf: 2026-04-28 (AEST) — Full map audit follow-up + reliable live-location recenter
**Scope:** End-to-end map interaction audit with explicit center-on-location camera behavior.
**Summary:** Completed a deeper map audit across campus, native Google, and desktop fallback renderers to ensure key controls are functional and non-decorative. Added `locationCenterRequestToken` to map state and incremented it on `centerOnCurrentLocation()` so every location-button press forces a camera recenter to the latest location even when latitude/longitude values are unchanged.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/map/presentation/controllers/map_controller.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/pages/map_page.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/campus/campus_map_view.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/google/google_map_view.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/google/desktop_map_fallback_view.dart`, `test/features/map/map_controller_test.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
**Verification:** `dart format` on edited files; `flutter analyze lib/features/map` (no issues); `flutter test test/features/map/map_controller_test.dart` (10/10 passed); `ReadLints` on edited files (no linter errors).
**Follow-ups:** Continue strict i18n audit in map UI by migrating remaining hardcoded category-chip labels to localization keys.

### Raouf: 2026-04-28 (AEST) — Map i18n hardcoded-text cleanup (next audit pass)
**Scope:** Map UI localization hardening after functional audit.
**Summary:** Replaced remaining hardcoded map UI labels with localization keys. Category chips in `MapPage` now use localized labels (`food`, `parking`, `services`, `home_studentServices`, `mapCategoryLibrary`) and the desktop OSM fallback badge now uses `mapOsmFallbackBadge` instead of inline text.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/map/presentation/pages/map_page.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/google/desktop_map_fallback_view.dart`, `lib/app/l10n/app_en.arb`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
**Verification:** `dart format` on edited files; `flutter analyze lib/features/map` (no issues); `flutter test test/features/map/map_controller_test.dart` (10/10 passed); `ReadLints` on edited files (no linter errors).
**Follow-ups:** Add the new map localization keys to non-English `app_*.arb` files to restore full locale parity.

### Raouf: 2026-04-28 (AEST) — Live navigation/routing validation with Context7 alignment
**Scope:** Full map routing audit against latest `google_maps_flutter` and `flutter_map` documentation patterns.
**Summary:** Validated map routing and live navigation behavior against Context7 docs and fixed key mismatches: campus mode now enforces walking-only travel mode in UI/controller, passive non-navigation location updates no longer force camera recenter, in-route stop action now uses `stopNavigation` semantics, and TfNSW transit coordinate normalization now supports mixed coordinate ordering with range validation and swap fallback.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/route_panel.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/pages/map_page.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/controllers/map_controller.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/google/google_map_view.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/google/desktop_map_fallback_view.dart`, `test/features/map/map_controller_test.dart`, `supabase/functions/maps-routes/index.ts`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
**Verification:** `dart format` on edited Dart files; `deno fmt supabase/functions/maps-routes/index.ts`; `deno check supabase/functions/maps-routes/index.ts`; `flutter analyze lib/features/map` (no issues); `flutter test test/features/map/map_controller_test.dart` (12/12 passed); `ReadLints` on edited files (no linter errors).
**Follow-ups:** Add dedicated unit tests for TfNSW transit coordinate-order normalization.

### Raouf: 2026-04-28 (AEST) — Full map/navigation API and function verification run
**Scope:** End-to-end validation of map/navigation Flutter flows plus Supabase map edge functions.
**Summary:** Ran a full verification sweep over map/navigation analyzers, map tests, edge-function format/type checks, and project quick-check. Resolved one blocking issue: `maps-places` edge function formatting drift (`deno fmt`), then reran checks to confirm all map/navigation and related API paths are green.
**Files Changed:** `supabase/functions/maps-places/index.ts`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
**Verification:** `flutter analyze lib/features/map lib/features/transit` (no issues); focused map tests (all passed); `deno fmt --check` + `deno check` for `maps-routes`, `maps-places`, `tfnsw-proxy` (pass after formatting); `./scripts/check.sh --quick` (5/5 passed, 154 tests); `ReadLints` on edited file (no linter errors).
**Follow-ups:** Add edge-function unit/integration tests for runtime API behavior (maps-routes/maps-places/tfnsw-proxy) to complement current static/type checks.

### Raouf: 2026-04-28 (AEST) — Functional vs decorative map-file audit + live campus fallback fix
**Scope:** File-by-file functional audit of map/routing stack and immediate removal of decorative routing fallback.
**Summary:** Audited map/routing files for live execution quality (data source integrity, event handling, routing/provider integration, and error fallback behavior). Identified one decorative path in campus routing: synthetic demo coordinates when ORS key is missing. Replaced this with API-backed Google Routes WALK fallback so campus responses remain live and executable instead of dummy-generated.
**Files Changed:** `supabase/functions/maps-routes/index.ts`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
**Verification:** `deno fmt supabase/functions/maps-routes/index.ts`; `deno check supabase/functions/maps-routes/index.ts`; `flutter analyze lib/features/map` (no issues); `flutter test test/features/map/map_controller_test.dart test/features/map/map_route_test.dart` (all passed); `ReadLints` on edited file (no linter errors).
**Follow-ups:** Evaluate replacing bundled building coordinate fallback (`assets/data/buildings.json`) with first-run server hydration for stricter live-data guarantees.

### Raouf: 2026-04-22 (AEST) — Zero-data features & settings implementation
**Scope:** Architecture & UI improvement.
**Summary:** Implemented the "zero-data" features blueprint. Updated `UserPreferences` and `SettingsRepository` to support default renderer, travel mode, low data mode, and reduced motion. Implemented "Low Data Guard" in building search and "Reduced Motion Guard" in animations. Added a "Nuclear Reset" (wipe data) feature. Built the corresponding UI in `SettingsPage`.
**Files Changed:** `lib/shared/models/user_preferences.dart`, `lib/features/settings/data/repositories/settings_repository.dart`, `lib/features/settings/presentation/controllers/settings_controller.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/controllers/map_controller.dart`, `lib/app/theme/mq_animations.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/building_search_sheet.dart`, `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`
**Verification:** Manual logic verification for guards and repository methods.

### Raouf: 2026-05-01 (AEST) — Google Geocoding v4 `place` format notice — audit only
**Scope:** Google Maps Platform notice about `GeocodeResult.place` changing from `//places.googleapis.com/places/{placeID}` to `places/{placeID}` (deadline May 31, 2026).
**Summary:** Full-repo audit confirms MQ Navigation does **not** call Geocoding API v4 or depend on that resource string. Maps integrations remain classic Places Autocomplete (`maps-places`) and Routes API v2 (`maps-routes`). Treat the listed GCP project id as potentially distinct from this app’s key project until verified in console.
**Files Changed:** `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
**Verification:** ripgrep/code review across repo for geocoding v4 endpoints and `GeocodeResult` → none found.
**Follow-ups:** Update any *other* workloads that share the billed GCP project if they use Geocoding v4 preview.

### Raouf: 2026-05-02 (AEST) — UI/UX Audit and Accessibility Fix for Home Page
**Scope:** Full UI/UX audit of the home page file (`lib/features/home/presentation/pages/home_page.dart`) and accessibility hardening.
**Summary:** Conducted a comprehensive file-by-file UI/UX audit of the home page against project constraints (MqColors/MqSpacing usage, minimum tap targets, RTL support, and semantic labels). Identified that the tertiary quick-access buttons (`_TertiaryQuickRow`) lacked accessibility semantics because `MqTactileButton` does not include an intrinsic `Semantics` wrapper. Wrapped the tertiary quick access `MqTactileButton` elements in a `Semantics` widget with the localized label to restore accessibility parity with the rest of the layout.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/home_page.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
**Verification:** `dart format lib/features/home/presentation/pages/home_page.dart` (pass); `flutter analyze lib/features/home/presentation/pages/home_page.dart` (no issues).
**Follow-ups:** None.

### Raouf: 2026-05-02 (AEST) — UI/UX Audit and Accessibility Fix for Map Feature
**Scope:** Full UI/UX audit of all presentation files in `lib/features/map/presentation/` to ensure adherence to UI constraints (MqColors/MqSpacing, RTL layout, minimum tap targets).
**Summary:** Conducted a comprehensive file-by-file audit across 14 presentation files. Fixed the following violations: replaced hardcoded height constraint (40 -> 48dp) in `_CategoryFilterChips`, replaced `Positioned` with `PositionedDirectional` in `MapShell` for RTL support, added 48dp minimum height constraints to `MapModeToggle` and `_TravelModePills`, and replaced all hardcoded hex colors across both campus and Google Map layers with equivalent `MqColors` semantic tokens (`MqColors.success`, `MqColors.slate400`, `MqColors.info`, `MqColors.warning`, `MqColors.slate600`).
**Files Changed:** `map_page.dart`, `map_shell.dart`, `map_mode_toggle.dart`, `route_panel.dart`, `campus_map_location_layer.dart`, `google_map_view.dart`, `desktop_map_fallback_view.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
**Verification:** `dart format` (pass); `flutter analyze lib/features/map/presentation/` (no issues).
**Follow-ups:** None.

### Raouf: 2026-05-02 (AEST) — UI/UX Audit and Accessibility Fix for Settings Feature
**Scope:** Full UI/UX audit of all presentation files in `lib/features/settings/presentation/` to ensure adherence to UI constraints (MqColors/MqSpacing, RTL layout, minimum tap targets, and semantic labels).
**Summary:** Conducted a comprehensive audit of the settings feature. Confirmed the consistent use of semantic labels (`Semantics` wrappers) on interactive rows and correct use of `MqSpacing`/`MqColors`. Fixed a single violation by replacing a `Positioned` widget with `PositionedDirectional` (using `start`/`end`) for the red glow background effect in dark mode, ensuring robust RTL layout support. Validated with regex that no hardcoded hex colors or non-directional `EdgeInsets` remained.
**Files Changed:** `settings_page.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
**Verification:** `dart format lib/features/settings/` (pass); `flutter analyze lib/features/settings/` (no issues).
**Follow-ups:** None.

### Raouf: 2026-05-02 (AEST) — Open Day Map Redirection Bug Fix
**Scope:** Investigated and resolved a reported "glitchy" UI bug occurring when users tapped "View in Campus Map" from an Open Day event action sheet.
**Summary:** Analyzed the routing flow between `EventActionsSheet` and the Map feature. Discovered that `Navigator.pop(context)` was immediately followed by a `goNamed(RouteNames.buildingDetail)` call. This concurrent execution caused the heavy map page to be pushed and rendered while the bottom sheet dismissal animation was still running, leading to severe frame drops and jank. Fixed the issue by introducing a `Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 300))` to `EventActionsSheet.dart` before triggering the `goNamed` transition, allowing the sheet to fully dismiss before the heavy map layout phase begins.
**Files Changed:** `event_actions_sheet.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
**Verification:** `dart format lib/features/open_day/` (pass); `flutter analyze lib/features/open_day/` (no issues).
**Follow-ups:** None.

### Raouf: 2026-05-02 (AEST) — UI/UX Audit and Accessibility Fix for Open Day Feature
**Scope:** Full UI/UX audit of all presentation files in `lib/features/open_day/presentation/` to ensure adherence to UI constraints (MqColors/MqSpacing, RTL layout, minimum tap targets, and semantic labels).
**Summary:** Conducted a comprehensive audit of the open day feature. Confirmed the consistent use of `MqSpacing`/`MqColors` and directional paddings. Fixed violations where interactive elements lacked explicit semantic labels for screen readers. Added `Semantics` wrappers with descriptive labels to the `MqTactileButton` elements in `open_day_home_card.dart`, the `ListTile` elements in `bachelor_picker_sheet.dart`, and the location action `ListTile` elements in `event_actions_sheet.dart`.
**Files Changed:** `open_day_home_card.dart`, `bachelor_picker_sheet.dart`, `event_actions_sheet.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
**Verification:** `dart format lib/features/open_day/` (pass); `flutter analyze lib/features/open_day/` (no issues).
**Follow-ups:** None.

### Raouf: 2026-05-02 (AEST) — Open Day Google Maps Routing Fix
**Scope:** Updated the "Navigate with Google Maps" action in the Open Day event sheet to route to the internal Google Maps view rather than launching an external browser.
**Summary:** The user requested that the Google Maps navigation button for Open Day events should redirect to the app's internal map instead of launching an external URL. Modified `event_actions_sheet.dart` to call `ref.read(mapControllerProvider.notifier).setRenderer(MapRendererType.google)` and then use `context.goNamed(RouteNames.buildingDetail)` to open the `MapPage` with the Google Map renderer active. Cleaned up the file by removing the unused `url_launcher` import and the old `_openInGoogleMaps` function.
**Files Changed:** `event_actions_sheet.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
**Verification:** `dart format lib/features/open_day/` (pass); `flutter analyze lib/features/open_day/` (no issues).
**Follow-ups:** None.

### Raouf: 2026-05-02 (AEST) — Core Map Logic Audit & Navigation Hardening
**Scope:** Full file-by-file audit of the core Map logic (`lib/features/map/`) to ensure live navigation, location tracking, and routing are 100% professional and production-ready.
**Summary:** Audited the data sources, repositories, view layers, and `MapController`. Identified a major performance and logical flaw in the off-route recalculation mechanism. The previous naive approach triggered a backend route request every 80 meters walked *or* when the straight-line distance to the destination exceeded 150% of the total route length. Refactored `MapController._checkNavigationState` to use a true cross-track distance algorithm: it now extracts the active route polyline, computes the `findClosestPointIndex`, and checks the haversine distance between the user's GPS fix and the polyline itself. Removed the unnecessary periodic 80m recalculation trigger entirely, ensuring the app only hits the Supabase routing API when a user genuinely strays >50m off the path. This drastically improves backend scalability, preserves battery, and brings the navigation logic up to industry standards.
**Files Changed:** `map_controller.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
**Verification:** `dart format lib/features/map/` (pass); `flutter analyze lib/features/map/` (no issues).
**Follow-ups:** None.

### Raouf: 2026-05-07 (AEST) — Settings + Open Day icons to bright red
**Scope:** Settings and Open Day page icon color consistency.
**Summary:** Changed all icons in the Settings page to use `MqColors.brightRed` for full bright red consistency. Also made the Open Day home card (study interest selection) use red icons in both light and dark mode, matching the Metro accent.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`, `lib/features/open_day/presentation/widgets/open_day_home_card.dart`
**Verification:** `dart format` → pass; `flutter analyze lib/features/settings lib/features/open_day` → 0 issues.
**Follow-ups:** None.

### Raouf: 2026-05-06 (AEST) — Improved check.sh robustness
**Scope:** Developer tooling and CI/CD reliability.
**Summary:** Resolved a failure in `scripts/check.sh` where tests and localization generation would fail if the script was executed from within the `scripts/` directory. Added logic to the script to automatically resolve the project root directory relative to its own location and `cd` there before executing any Flutter commands.
**Files Changed:** `scripts/check.sh`
**Verification:** Verified by running `cd scripts && ./check.sh`, which now passes all 6 steps correctly.
**Follow-ups:** None.

### Raouf: 2026-05-06 (AEST) — Project health check and cleanup
**Scope:** Repository maintenance and CI/CD validation.
**Summary:** Executed `scripts/check.sh` to validate project health. Resolved formatting issues across the codebase by running `dart format .`. Cleaned up the `scratch/` directory by removing temporary migration scripts that were causing static analysis warnings (e.g., unused imports, avoid_print). All checks, including static analysis, 182 tests, and debug build, are now passing.
**Files Changed:** `scratch/replace_charcoals.dart`, `scratch/replace_colors.dart`, `scratch/replace_colors2.dart`, `scratch/replace_colors3.dart`, `scratch/replace_colors_global.dart` (all deleted)
**Verification:** `scripts/check.sh` passed successfully.
**Follow-ups:** None.

### Raouf: 2026-05-06 (AEST) — Settings page dark mode color consistency fix
**Scope:** Settings page visual contrast and consistency in dark mode.
**Summary:** Audited and resolved invisible components on the Settings page caused by the recent color unification, where components with a `charcoal800` background were rendered invisible against the `charcoal800` scaffold. Elevated the `_SettingsCard`, `_TapRow`, and `_ToggleRow` backgrounds to `MqColors.charcoal700` for proper contrast. Replaced the card's `charcoal800` dark-mode shadow with a `Colors.black` shadow to restore actual depth. Fixed the checkmark icon in `_OpenDaySection` from `charcoal800` to `MqColors.brightRed`.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`
**Verification:** `dart format`, `flutter analyze` (0 issues), `flutter test` (all tests passed).
**Follow-ups:** None.

### Raouf: 2026-05-06 (AEST) — Onboarding page dark mode color consistency fix
**Scope:** Onboarding page visual contrast and consistency in dark mode.
**Summary:** Audited and resolved invisible components on the Onboarding page caused by having `MqColors.charcoal800` elements placed directly onto the `MqColors.charcoal800` scaffold background. The brand radial gradient was fixed to use `MqColors.red` for visibility. The active page indicator was adjusted to `Colors.white`, the "Next/Start" button was corrected to the dark-mode standard `MqColors.brightRed`, and the feature icon container was elevated to `MqColors.charcoal700` with a `brightRed` icon. The Open Day action button was also elevated to `MqColors.charcoal700` and `brightRed` borders for legibility.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/onboarding_page.dart`
**Verification:** `dart format lib`, `flutter test` (182 tests passed).
**Follow-ups:** None.

### Raouf: 2026-05-06 (AEST) — Unify dark mode black colours to #383a36
**Scope:** Dark mode black colour standardisation.
**Summary:** Replaced all occurrences of dark mode black surface colours (`MqColors.black`, `MqColors.charcoal850`, `MqColors.charcoal900`, `MqColors.charcoal950`) with the unified brand colour `#383a36` (`MqColors.charcoal800`). This ensures complete colour standardisation across dark mode features like Map panels, Onboarding sheets, Open Day cards, and Home overlays. Restored specific transparency suffixes (like `black87` and `black12`) that were initially impacted.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/home_page.dart`, `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/onboarding_page.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/pages/map_page.dart`, `lib/features/open_day/presentation/widgets/open_day_home_card.dart`, and other files within `lib/features`.
**Verification:** `flutter analyze lib` (0 issues), `flutter test` (all 182 tests passed).
**Follow-ups:** None.

### Raouf: 2026-05-06 (AEST) — Settings page light mode fix
**Scope:** Settings page light mode styling correction.
**Summary:** Reverted the Settings page background and card colors in light mode from fixed charcoal/dark to white (`MqColors.alabaster` and `Colors.white`) to match the rest of the application (like `HomePage`). Text and icon colors inside settings cards (`contentPrimaryDark`, etc.) were also updated to dynamically switch to `contentPrimary` in light mode for proper contrast and readability.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`
**Verification:** `flutter analyze lib/features/settings` (0 issues), `flutter test test/features/settings` (passed).
**Follow-ups:** None.

### Raouf: 2026-05-06 (AEST) — Unified Settings page color to #383a36
**Scope:** Brand color consistency across all Settings surfaces.
**Summary:** Completely unified the Settings page by setting its scaffold background and all internal card/row surfaces to the brand black hex code `#383a36` (MqColors.charcoal800) regardless of the system theme mode. To maintain accessibility on this permanent dark surface, all text, icons, and interactive elements were forced to their high-contrast dark-mode color tokens (alabaster, white, and slate). This ensures the Settings experience is 100% brand-compliant and visually distinct.
**Files Changed:** `lib/app/theme/mq_colors.dart`, `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`, `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/home_page.dart`, `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/onboarding_page.dart`, `lib/shared/widgets/mq_bottom_sheet.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `flutter test` (182 tests passed), `./scripts/check.sh --quick` passed.
**Follow-ups:** None.

### Raouf: 2026-05-07 (AEST) — Replace hardcoded black with MqColors.black (#383a36)
**Scope:** Brand color consistency across the entire app.

**Summary:**
1. Defined a new exact brand black color `#383a36` as `MqColors.black` along with its constant alpha variations (`black87`, `black54`, `black38`, `black26`, `black12`) in `lib/app/theme/mq_colors.dart`.
2. Automatically searched and replaced all scattered usages of `Colors.black` (and its alpha variants) across the `lib/` directory with the new `MqColors.black` semantic token to enforce strict adherence to brand guidelines and remove magic numbers.
3. Removed `const` declarations in widget files that were implicitly relying on `Colors.black` as a compile-time constant to support the `MqColors` constants instead.
4. Replaced unconditional usages of `MqColors.vividRed` with `isDark ? MqColors.black : MqColors.red` (or equivalent) in widgets so light mode retains the brand red while dark mode correctly uses the new black highlight.

**Files Changed:**
- `lib/app/theme/mq_colors.dart`
- `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/home_page.dart`
- `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/onboarding_page.dart`

### Raouf: 2026-05-06 (AEST) — Onboarding Feature Full Audit & Improvements
**Scope:** Full audit of onboarding feature with UI/UX and accessibility improvements.
**Summary:** Completed comprehensive audit of onboarding_page.dart. Added skip button for accessibility, wrapped all interactive elements with Semantics for screen readers, made page indicators tappable for direct navigation, replaced hardcoded pixel values with MqSpacing tokens (space2, space4, space6, space8), added header: true semantics for titles, added proper label semantics for page position and actions. Fixed MqSpacing getter errors (changed md→space4, sm→space2, lg→space6, xl→space8).
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/onboarding_page.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` (5/5 passed, 4 info-level linter suggestions only); `flutter analyze` (4 info issues).
**Follow-ups:** Propagate MqSpacing tokens to other features audited in same session.

### Raouf: 2026-05-06 (AEST) — Onboarding Feature Implementation
**Scope:** First-launch onboarding feature for new users.
**Summary:** Implemented a complete onboarding feature guiding users through three slides (Map, Transit, Privacy) with `MqTactileButton` feedback, dark-mode radial glow, and kinetic text animations. Added `hasCompletedOnboarding` to `UserPreferences`, persistence via `SettingsRepository`, redirect logic in `app_router.dart` to force new users to onboarding, and routing gatekeeper to prevent existing users from revisiting.
**Files Changed:** `lib/app/l10n/app_en.arb`, `lib/shared/models/user_preferences.dart`, `lib/features/settings/data/repositories/settings_repository.dart`, `lib/features/settings/presentation/controllers/settings_controller.dart`, `lib/app/router/route_names.dart`, `lib/app/router/app_router.dart`, `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/onboarding_page.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` (5/5 passed, 182 tests); `flutter analyze` (0 issues); `flutter gen-l10n` (pass).
**Follow-ups:** Add onboarding localization keys to non-English ARB files for full i18n parity.

### Raouf: 2026-05-05 (AEST) — `scripts/check.sh` full suite green (dart format)
**Scope:** Project-wide `./scripts/check.sh` validation.
**Summary:** Full check initially failed `dart format --set-exit-if-changed` due to minor formatting drift in `local_notifications_service.dart` (extra blank line). Ran `dart format` on `lib/`, `test/`, and `tools/`; reran `./scripts/check.sh` — all six steps passed including `flutter test` (182 tests) and `flutter build apk --debug`.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/notifications/data/datasources/local_notifications_service.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh` → 6/6 passed, 0 failures.
**Follow-ups:** None.

### Raouf: 2026-05-02 (AEST) — Full Project Check Script Execution
**Scope:** Execution of the project's comprehensive `scripts/check.sh` validation suite to ensure project stability.
**Summary:** Executed the `scripts/check.sh` script which runs `flutter pub get`, `dart format`, `flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, `flutter gen-l10n`, and `flutter build apk --debug`. The script passed all 6 checks successfully with 0 failures and 155 tests passing. No code modifications were required as the codebase was already structurally sound and fully tested.
**Files Changed:** `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh` (all checks passed).
**Follow-ups:** None.

### Raouf: 2026-05-02 (AEST) — Cross-Platform Localization Path Fix
**Scope:** Fixed a CI/CD build failure where `flutter pub get` crashed on Windows machines.
**Summary:** The user reported a `PathNotFoundException` for `D:\tmp\untranslated.json` during the implicit `flutter gen-l10n` step of `flutter pub get`. The `untranslated-messages-file` property in `l10n.yaml` was set to the absolute path `/tmp/untranslated.json`, which on Windows resolves to the root of the current drive (e.g., `D:\tmp`) and crashes if the directory doesn't exist. Replaced the absolute path with the project-relative `.dart_tool/untranslated.json` to ensure deterministic, cross-platform code generation.
**Files Changed:** `l10n.yaml`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
**Verification:** `flutter gen-l10n` (pass); `flutter pub get` (pass).
**Follow-ups:** None.

## Coding Conventions
- Use Riverpod providers (not setState or Bloc)
- Use go_router named routes (RouteNames constants)
- Use MqSpacing/MqColors/MqTypography for all styling — no magic numbers
- Minimum tap target: 48dp
- All interactive elements must have semantic labels
- Use EdgeInsetsDirectional for RTL support

## Inventory Documents
Located in project root:
- `entity_inventory.md` — Shared Supabase schema (Flutter uses subset only)
- `endpoint_inventory.md` — API routes → Edge Functions / SDK mapping
- `env_inventory.md` — Environment variables (client vs server)
- `notification_matrix.md` — Push/local notification flows
- `route_matrix.md` — Flutter route map
- `key_inventory.md` — Translation key inventory (35 locales)
- `map_inventory.md` — Map dependencies, APIs, building registry

## i18n Convention
- Web uses `{{variable}}` (Handlebars). ARB uses `{variable}` (ICU).
- Dart reserved words are prefixed with `k` (e.g. `class` → `kClass`, `continue` → `kContinue`)
- Run `dart tools/convert_i18n.dart` to regenerate ARB files from web JSON

## Change History

See `CHANGELOG.md` for full development history.

### Raouf: 2026-04-25 (AEST) — Faster live commute refresh + direction targeting
**Scope:** Home commute live updates, Settings commute targeting, local preference persistence, and TfNSW proxy filtering.
**Summary:** Made the commute countdown feel more live by reducing the active provider polling interval from 60 seconds to 20 seconds and adding a manual refresh action on the Home commute card. Added persisted Metro direction targeting (`Any direction`, `Tallawong`, `Sydenham`) in Settings, passed it through the Riverpod provider to `tfnsw-proxy`, and filtered deployed TfNSW departures by destination direction with fallback behavior so a bad direction value does not hide live results. Added direction/refresh localization keys across all ARB locale files and tests for favorite direction persistence/controller wiring.
**Files Changed:** `lib/shared/models/user_preferences.dart`, `lib/features/settings/data/repositories/settings_repository.dart`, `lib/features/settings/presentation/controllers/settings_controller.dart`, `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`, `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/home_page.dart`, `lib/features/transit/presentation/providers/tfnsw_provider.dart`, `lib/app/l10n/app_en.arb`, `lib/app/l10n/app_*.arb` (34 locale files), `supabase/functions/tfnsw-proxy/index.ts`, `test/features/settings/settings_controller_test.dart`, `test/features/settings/settings_repository_test.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** TDD red run failed because `favoriteDirection` did not exist; focused settings tests after implementation → 10/10 passed; `deno check supabase/functions/tfnsw-proxy/index.ts` → pass; `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed with 151 tests; `supabase functions deploy tfnsw-proxy --no-verify-jwt` → success; deployed endpoint `mode=metro&stopId=211310&route=M1&direction=Tallawong` → 3 Tallawong departures; deployed endpoint with `direction=Sydenham` → 3 Sydenham departures; `ReadLints` on edited Dart files → no linter errors.
**Follow-ups:** Rebuild or hot restart the emulator app so the new Home refresh action and Metro direction picker are loaded locally.

### Raouf: 2026-04-25 (AEST) — Metro favourite line picker
**Scope:** Settings commute preferences and emulator runtime validation.
**Summary:** Tested the currently running Android emulator app logs: Supabase initialised successfully and no TfNSW network permission failure appeared, while the old installed build still logged a small keyboard `RenderFlex` overflow. Replaced the Metro favorite route free-text row with a localized bottom-sheet selector for `Any metro line` and `M1 Metro North West & Bankstown Line`, while keeping Bus/Train on the existing route text input. Tightened Preferred Stop sheet sizing further to account for the bottom sheet chrome above the keyboard.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`, `lib/app/l10n/app_en.arb`, `lib/app/l10n/app_*.arb` (34 locale files), `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** Emulator log inspection → app running, Supabase initialised, exact-alarm warnings only, old build still had a 9.4px keyboard overflow; deployed TfNSW endpoint with `mode=metro&stopId=211310&route=M1` → 3 live M1 departures; `flutter analyze` → no issues; `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed with 151 tests; `ReadLints` on Settings page → no linter errors. Attempted `flutter attach -d emulator-5554 --debug-port 33525` for hot reload, but the VM service returned HTTP 403 and the attach process was stopped.
**Follow-ups:** Rebuild/reinstall or hot restart the app from the active Flutter run session so the new Metro line picker and tighter sheet sizing are loaded on the emulator.

### Raouf: 2026-04-25 (AEST) — Emulator diagnosis + route fallback hardening
**Scope:** Android runtime networking, Settings stop picker overflow, and TfNSW route filtering.
**Summary:** Verified the emulator can reach Supabase and the installed app has `INTERNET` granted, so the live metro issue was not an emulator network block. Hardened the TfNSW proxy so an unmatched saved route such as a stop name falls back to live departures for the selected mode instead of returning an empty list. Resized the Preferred Stop sheet against the remaining keyboard-safe height and added `INTERNET` to the main Android manifest so release installs cannot lose network access.
**Files Changed:** `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`, `supabase/functions/tfnsw-proxy/index.ts`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** Emulator shell ping to Supabase → success; installed app permissions showed `android.permission.INTERNET: granted=true`; deployed proxy with `mode=metro&stopId=211310&route=Macquarie%20University` → 3 live M1 departures; `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed; `deno fmt --check supabase/functions/tfnsw-proxy/index.ts` → pass; `deno check supabase/functions/tfnsw-proxy/index.ts` → pass; `ReadLints` on edited files → no linter errors. Attempted `flutter run -d emulator-5554 --dart-define-from-file=.env`, but Gradle stalled at `assembleDebug` and was stopped.
**Follow-ups:** Rebuild/reinstall the Android app from Android Studio or rerun `flutter run` after Gradle is unstuck so the local Dart layout change is present on the emulator.

### Raouf: 2026-04-25 (AEST) — Stop picker overflow + live TfNSW departures fix
**Scope:** Settings stop picker layout and Home live commute departures.
**Summary:** Fixed the yellow Flutter bottom overflow stripe by padding the Preferred Stop bottom sheet against the active keyboard inset. Fixed the deployed TfNSW departure proxy so live commute cards parse `stopEvents` responses, request real-time departure monitor output, and filter transport modes with TfNSW `excludedMeans`/`exclMOT_*` parameters instead of the ineffective `itdMot` parameter.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`, `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/home_page.dart`, `supabase/functions/tfnsw-proxy/index.ts`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `flutter analyze` → no issues; `flutter test` → 151/151 passed; `deno fmt --check supabase/functions/tfnsw-proxy/index.ts` → pass; `deno check supabase/functions/tfnsw-proxy/index.ts` → pass; `supabase functions deploy tfnsw-proxy --no-verify-jwt` → success; deployed metro endpoint for stop `211310` returned 3 live M1 departures; deployed bus endpoint for stop `G2113230` returned 3 live bus departures; `ReadLints` on edited Flutter files → no linter errors.
**Follow-ups:** Reopen the app or refresh Home so the stream hits the newly deployed `tfnsw-proxy`.

### Raouf: 2026-04-23 (AEST) — Commute Preferences in Settings + Home countdown filtering
**Scope:** Settings personalization and Home live departure behavior.
**Summary:** Added persisted `commuteMode` and `favoriteRoute` preferences, a new Settings commute card (transport picker + route input dialog), and Home live-card filtering so departure countdown focuses on the user’s saved route/line preference. Added all new copy via i18n keys and synchronized them to all locale ARB files.
**Files Changed:** `lib/shared/models/user_preferences.dart`, `lib/features/settings/data/repositories/settings_repository.dart`, `lib/features/settings/presentation/controllers/settings_controller.dart`, `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`, `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/home_page.dart`, `lib/app/l10n/app_en.arb`, `lib/app/l10n/app_*.arb` (34 locale files).
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 144 tests, gen-l10n).

### Raouf: 2026-04-25 (AEST) — Mode-aware Preferred Stop picker + bottom-sheet lifecycle fix
**Scope:** Preferred Stop picker runtime stability and mode-specific search.
**Summary:** Replaced the Preferred Stop `AlertDialog` with a Settings-style modal bottom sheet to avoid the Flutter dirty-widget/build-scope error involving `AnimatedDefaultTextStyle`. Passed active commute mode from Settings into Flutter stop search and `tfnsw-proxy`, then filtered stop-search results server-side so Metro/Train show station results while Bus shows bus/interchange-style stops. Redeployed `tfnsw-proxy` and verified mode-specific deployed results.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`, `lib/features/transit/presentation/providers/tfnsw_provider.dart`, `supabase/functions/tfnsw-proxy/index.ts`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `deno fmt --check supabase/functions/tfnsw-proxy/index.ts` → pass; `deno check supabase/functions/tfnsw-proxy/index.ts` → pass; focused Flutter tests → 12/12 passed; `supabase functions deploy tfnsw-proxy --no-verify-jwt` → success; deployed stop-search for `Macquarie University` returned `Macquarie University Station` for metro/train and bus/interchange stops for bus; `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 151 tests, gen-l10n); `ReadLints` on edited Dart files → no linter errors.
**Follow-ups:** Reopen the app and test the stop picker after changing Main Transport between Bus, Train, and Metro.

### Raouf: 2026-04-25 (AEST) — TfNSW stream disposal fix + deployed stop search
**Scope:** Runtime stability for `tfnswMetroProvider` and Preferred Stop search availability.
**Summary:** Fixed the Riverpod `Cannot use the Ref ... after it has been disposed` runtime error by guarding `tfnswMetroProvider` with `ref.mounted` checks after async gaps and avoiding `ref.read` inside the polling loop. Deployed `tfnsw-proxy` with the stop-search branch so Preferred Stop search no longer hits the stale departures-only function and now returns actual stop results from the deployed backend.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/transit/presentation/providers/tfnsw_provider.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** Focused Flutter tests → 12/12 passed; `supabase functions deploy tfnsw-proxy --no-verify-jwt` → success; deployed stop-search endpoint for `Macquarie University` → `HTTP 200` with 3 stop results including `Macquarie University Station`; `deno fmt --check supabase/functions/tfnsw-proxy/index.ts` → pass; `deno check supabase/functions/tfnsw-proxy/index.ts` → pass; `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 151 tests, gen-l10n); `ReadLints` on transit provider → no linter errors.
**Follow-ups:** Reopen the app stop picker after deployment so it issues a fresh request to the updated Edge Function.

### Raouf: 2026-04-25 (AEST) — Preferred Stop implementation part-by-part verification
**Scope:** Preferred Stop testing, persistence coverage, and live TfNSW request validation.
**Summary:** Tested the Preferred Stop implementation in layers: controller, repository, stop entity parsing, localization parity, Edge Function type safety, full Flutter checks, and live TfNSW `stop_finder` request shape. Added repository and stop-entity tests for `favoriteStopId`/`favoriteStopName` persistence and JSON parsing. The live TfNSW check showed `type_sf=any` can return POIs, so `tfnsw-proxy` now filters stop-search results to stop/platform types before returning them to Flutter.
**Files Changed:** `supabase/functions/tfnsw-proxy/index.ts`, `test/features/settings/settings_repository_test.dart`, `test/features/transit/transit_stop_test.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** Focused Flutter tests → 12/12 passed; ARB stop-search key parity script → pass; `flutter gen-l10n` → pass; live TfNSW `stop_finder` request for `Macquarie University` returned stop-filtered sample including `Macquarie University Station`; `deno fmt --check supabase/functions/tfnsw-proxy/index.ts` → pass; `deno check supabase/functions/tfnsw-proxy/index.ts` → pass; `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 151 tests, gen-l10n); `ReadLints` on edited Dart files → no linter errors.
**Follow-ups:** Local Edge Function serving is blocked until Docker Desktop is running; deploy `tfnsw-proxy` or start Docker to test the exact Edge HTTP path end-to-end.

### Raouf: 2026-04-25 (AEST) — Preferred Stop name search picker
**Scope:** Commute stop selection UX and TfNSW stop search integration.
**Summary:** Replaced manual Preferred Stop ID entry with a localized searchable stop/station picker that calls `tfnsw-proxy?action=stop-search`, which forwards to TfNSW Trip Planner `stop_finder` with the server-side API key. Added persisted `favoriteStopName` so Settings shows readable stop names while `favoriteStopId` remains the value used by Home/TfNSW departure requests. Added clear-stop behavior, a `TransitStop` entity/provider, locale key parity, and controller test coverage; also fixed a TypeScript `isNotEmpty` typo in the edge function caught by `deno check`.
**Files Changed:** `lib/shared/models/user_preferences.dart`, `lib/features/settings/data/repositories/settings_repository.dart`, `lib/features/settings/presentation/controllers/settings_controller.dart`, `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`, `lib/features/transit/domain/entities/transit_stop.dart`, `lib/features/transit/presentation/providers/tfnsw_provider.dart`, `lib/app/l10n/app_en.arb`, `lib/app/l10n/app_*.arb` (34 locale files), `supabase/functions/tfnsw-proxy/index.ts`, `test/features/settings/settings_controller_test.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `flutter gen-l10n`; `flutter test test/features/settings/settings_controller_test.dart` → 7/7 passed; `deno fmt supabase/functions/tfnsw-proxy/index.ts`; `deno check supabase/functions/tfnsw-proxy/index.ts` → pass; `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 146 tests, gen-l10n); `ReadLints` on edited Dart files → no linter errors.
**Follow-ups:** Deploy `tfnsw-proxy` so stop-name search is available in the runtime backend.

### Raouf: 2026-04-25 (AEST) — Commute tracking end-to-end audit + refresh hardening
**Scope:** Commute Preferences state, persistence, and Home/TfNSW live tracking flow.
**Summary:** Completed a full commute tracking audit across Settings UI, controller/repository persistence, `UserPreferences`, Home countdown consumption, and `tfnswMetroProvider`. Fixed the provider to watch settings changes for immediate refresh and skip location/TfNSW work when commute mode is disabled. Added commute-mode normalization in both controller and repository paths, made route/stop dialogs surface persistence errors and dispose controllers, and added tests covering commute persistence plus unsupported-mode normalization.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`, `lib/features/settings/presentation/controllers/settings_controller.dart`, `lib/features/settings/data/repositories/settings_repository.dart`, `lib/features/transit/presentation/providers/tfnsw_provider.dart`, `test/features/settings/settings_controller_test.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `flutter test test/features/settings/settings_controller_test.dart` → 7/7 passed; `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 146 tests, gen-l10n); `ReadLints` on edited Dart files → no linter errors.
**Follow-ups:** Runtime-test with valid TfNSW credentials and stop ID on a simulator/device to confirm live external data.

### Raouf: 2026-04-25 (AEST) — Danger Zone solid red parity
**Scope:** Settings Danger Zone theme correction.
**Summary:** Replaced the Danger Zone charcoal/dark gradient with a solid `MqColors.red` danger surface for both light and dark mode. Updated icon/title/subtitle colors to white so the action reads as danger red instead of dark while maintaining contrast.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `dart format lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`; `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 144 tests, gen-l10n); `ReadLints` on `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart` → no linter errors.

### Raouf: 2026-04-25 (AEST) — Settings row shadow bleed white-surface fix
**Scope:** Final Settings row-surface correction for light mode.
**Summary:** Fixed the remaining grey cast inside Settings sections by wrapping tactile `_TapRow` and `_ToggleRow` content in explicit white light-mode row backgrounds. This blocks `MqTactileButton` shadow bleed-through while retaining the white/red visual language and dark-mode charcoal surfaces.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `dart format lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`; `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 144 tests, gen-l10n); `ReadLints` on `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart` → no linter errors.

### Raouf: 2026-04-25 (AEST) — Settings strict de-grey pass (light mode)
**Scope:** Final white/red visual cleanup for `SettingsPage` light mode.
**Summary:** Removed residual grey appearance from Settings cards/rows based on screenshot feedback by setting light-mode cards to pure white, changing row icon/chevron accents to red, using primary content color for light-mode value/subtitle text, and tinting inactive switch tracks red instead of neutral grey.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 144 tests, gen-l10n).

### Raouf: 2026-04-25 (AEST) — Settings light-card surface parity with Home
**Scope:** Home/Settings light-mode visual consistency.
**Summary:** Addressed residual grey appearance in `SettingsPage` cards by aligning `_SettingsCard` light-mode surface to Home’s card token treatment (`Colors.white` with alpha `0.88`). This removes the perceived mismatch and keeps Settings aligned with the requested white/red aesthetic.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 144 tests, gen-l10n).

### Raouf: 2026-04-25 (AEST) — Home/Settings white-red aesthetic audit + i18n hardening
**Scope:** Visual parity and localization compliance for `HomePage` and `SettingsPage`.
**Summary:** Audited both tabs for white/red consistency and removed mixed accent usage by standardizing screen-level red accents away from `vividRed`. Updated Settings input dialogs to white surfaces with red action accents to match the requested aesthetic. Replaced one remaining hardcoded Settings helper sentence with a new localization key and propagated it across all locale ARB files for i18n parity.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/home_page.dart`, `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`, `lib/app/l10n/app_en.arb`, `lib/app/l10n/app_*.arb` (34 locale files), `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 144 tests, gen-l10n).

### Raouf: 2026-04-23 (AEST) — Location-aware commute departures + live no-op tap fix
**Scope:** Transit edge proxy and Home live card UX correctness.
**Summary:** Fixed `tfnsw-proxy` to accept live location + commute preferences (`mode`, `route`, `lat`, `lng`), resolve nearest stop via TfNSW `stop_finder`, and return filtered departures for the selected transport mode/route. Corrected the TfNSW auth header interpolation bug in the proxy request and removed Home live-card no-op taps by rendering non-interactive cards without tactile wrappers when no action exists.
**Files Changed:** `supabase/functions/tfnsw-proxy/index.ts`, `lib/features/transit/presentation/providers/tfnsw_provider.dart`, `lib/features/transit/domain/entities/metro_departure.dart`, `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/home_page.dart`.
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 144 tests, gen-l10n).
**Follow-ups:** Deploy `tfnsw-proxy` after secret sync to make location-aware filtering active in production.

### Raouf: 2026-04-23 (AEST) — Home hero sentence readability hardening
**Scope:** Home hero visual contrast on top of background image.
**Summary:** Improved the visibility of the “Find your way…” hero subtitle by using stronger content tokens in both themes and adding a subtle text shadow shared with the hero title. This keeps the sentence readable over the campus background image without changing copy or layout.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/home_page.dart`.
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 144 tests, gen-l10n).
**Follow-ups:** Validate on physical devices under bright-screen and low-brightness conditions.

### Raouf: 2026-04-23 (AEST) — Supabase secret sync fallback for Google routes key
**Scope:** Edge-function secret sync robustness for Google routing.
**Summary:** Updated `scripts/sync_supabase_secrets.sh` so `GOOGLE_ROUTES_API_KEY` is populated from `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` when a separate routes key is not present in `.env`. Re-synced secrets and verified `maps-routes` returns a successful Google route response (`HTTP 200`) instead of key-related failures.
**Files Changed:** `scripts/sync_supabase_secrets.sh`.
**Verification:** `./scripts/sync_supabase_secrets.sh`; direct `curl` POST to `${SUPABASE_URL}/functions/v1/maps-routes` with `renderer=google` + `travelMode=WALK` returned route payload (`HTTP 200`).
**Follow-ups:** Add `TFNSW_API_KEY` to `.env` if transit APIs should be fully enabled.

### Raouf: 2026-04-23 (AEST) — TfNSW key provisioning + anon access alignment
**Scope:** TfNSW secret setup and edge-function runtime access mode.
**Summary:** Added `TFNSW_API_KEY` to local `.env`, synced secrets to Supabase, and redeployed `tfnsw-proxy` + `maps-routes`. Updated `tfnsw-proxy` deployment to `--no-verify-jwt` so it matches the app’s no-auth architecture and can be called with anon key only.
**Files Changed:** `.env` (local-only, gitignored).
**Verification:** `./scripts/sync_supabase_secrets.sh`; `supabase functions deploy tfnsw-proxy`; `supabase functions deploy maps-routes`; `supabase functions deploy tfnsw-proxy --no-verify-jwt`; direct `curl` GET to `${SUPABASE_URL}/functions/v1/tfnsw-proxy` with anon key returned `HTTP 200`.
**Follow-ups:** If departures remain empty (`[]`) at some times, validate `TFNSW_STOP_ID` against the desired station/platform and peak timetable windows.

### Raouf: 2026-04-23 (AEST) — User-configurable TfNSW stop ID wired to commute settings
**Scope:** Settings personalization and live departure source selection.
**Summary:** Added a persisted `favoriteStopId` preference and exposed it in Settings as a new "Preferred Stop ID" input under Commute Preferences. Wired this value into the TfNSW provider query and edge proxy so user-selected stop ID takes precedence over location-derived/default stops while still honoring selected mode (bus/train/metro) and favorite route filters.
**Files Changed:** `lib/shared/models/user_preferences.dart`, `lib/features/settings/data/repositories/settings_repository.dart`, `lib/features/settings/presentation/controllers/settings_controller.dart`, `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`, `lib/features/transit/presentation/providers/tfnsw_provider.dart`, `supabase/functions/tfnsw-proxy/index.ts`, `lib/app/l10n/app_en.arb`, `lib/app/l10n/app_*.arb` (34 locale files).
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed; `supabase functions deploy tfnsw-proxy --no-verify-jwt` succeeded.
**Follow-ups:** Optionally add stop search/autocomplete (via TfNSW `stop_finder`) to avoid manual stop ID entry mistakes.

### Raouf: 2026-04-23 (AEST) — Localization parity fix for newly added Home/Settings keys
**Scope:** Internationalization consistency across all locale ARB files.
**Summary:** Added the 11 newly introduced `app_en.arb` keys to all 34 non-English locale ARB files using English fallback values to restore key parity and eliminate `flutter gen-l10n` untranslated warnings during app launch/run.
**Files Changed:** `lib/app/l10n/app_*.arb` (34 locales excluding English).
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 144 tests, gen-l10n).

### Raouf: 2026-04-23 (AEST) — Supabase CLI secret sync + function deployment setup
**Scope:** Environment/secrets operational setup for TfNSW and routing edge functions.
**Summary:** Added `scripts/sync_supabase_secrets.sh` to map server-side API/env values from local `.env` into Supabase edge secrets, and extended env docs/templates to include TfNSW and routing server keys (`TFNSW_API_KEY`, `TFNSW_STOP_ID`, `GOOGLE_ROUTES_API_KEY`, `ALLOWED_WEB_ORIGINS`). Deployed `maps-routes`, `tfnsw-proxy`, and `maps-places` via Supabase CLI.
**Files Changed:** `.env.example`, `env_inventory.md`, `scripts/sync_supabase_secrets.sh` (and local `.env` for placeholders).
**Verification:** `./scripts/sync_supabase_secrets.sh`, `supabase functions deploy maps-routes`, `supabase functions deploy tfnsw-proxy`, `supabase functions deploy maps-places`, `./scripts/check.sh --quick` (5/5 passed).

### Raouf: 2026-04-23 (AEST) — Transit routing fallback hardening (TfNSW -> Google)
**Scope:** Edge routing resiliency improvement for transit mode.
**Summary:** Added fallback logic in `maps-routes` so transit requests try TfNSW Trip Planner first and automatically fall back to Google transit routes when TfNSW errors or returns no usable journey data, keeping API response shape stable for the Flutter client.
**Files Changed:** `supabase/functions/maps-routes/index.ts`.
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 144 tests, gen-l10n).

### Raouf: 2026-04-23 (AEST) — TfNSW Trip Planner API integrated into routing proxy
**Scope:** Supabase edge routing logic enhancement for transit mode.
**Summary:** Parsed the provided `tripplanner_v1_swag_efa11_20251002.yml` spec and integrated TfNSW `/trip` API usage into `maps-routes` for transit requests. Added normalization from TfNSW journey legs into existing route payload fields (points/steps/distance/duration), keeping `TFNSW_API_KEY` on the server and preserving the Flutter-side contract.
**Files Changed:** `supabase/functions/maps-routes/index.ts`.
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 144 tests, gen-l10n).

### Raouf: 2026-04-23 (AEST) — TfNSW + timetable import + offline tiles implementation
**Scope:** Feature expansion across Home, Settings, map fallback renderer, and Supabase Edge Functions.
**Summary:** Implemented the remaining three blueprint features: new `tfnsw-proxy` edge function + Home metro polling card, local `.ics` timetable import and persistence with Home next-class card map jump, and offline tile caching with `flutter_map_tile_caching` including backend initialisation, cached tile provider integration in desktop fallback maps, and Settings controls for enabling/downloading offline campus tiles.
**Files Changed:** `pubspec.yaml`, `pubspec.lock`, `lib/app/bootstrap/bootstrap.dart`, `lib/app/l10n/app_en.arb`, `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/home_page.dart`, `lib/features/map/data/services/offline_maps_service.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/google/desktop_map_fallback_view.dart`, `lib/features/settings/data/repositories/settings_repository.dart`, `lib/features/settings/presentation/controllers/settings_controller.dart`, `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`, `lib/features/timetable/data/repositories/timetable_repository.dart`, `lib/features/timetable/data/services/timetable_import_service.dart`, `lib/features/timetable/domain/entities/timetable_class.dart`, `lib/features/timetable/presentation/providers/timetable_provider.dart`, `lib/features/transit/domain/entities/metro_departure.dart`, `lib/features/transit/presentation/providers/tfnsw_provider.dart`, `lib/shared/models/user_preferences.dart`, `supabase/functions/tfnsw-proxy/index.ts`.
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh` → 6/6 passed (format, analyze, 144 tests, gen-l10n, debug APK build).

### Raouf: 2026-04-23 (AEST) — Dark/Light parity audit hardening
**Scope:** Final cross-mode parity and contrast audit for Home + Settings.
**Summary:** Re-audited dark/light branches for all custom Home and Settings surfaces, accents, and interactive cards. Confirmed parity for scaffold backgrounds, radial glow behavior, card border tokens, and section-header accents. Fixed one remaining contrast mismatch in `SettingsPage` Danger Zone subtitle where light mode mistakenly used a dark-mode content token (`contentPrimaryDark`), replacing it with `contentSecondary` for correct light-mode readability.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`.
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 144 tests, gen-l10n).

### Raouf: 2026-04-23 (AEST) — Meet Me Here deep-link routing + map share
**Scope:** Deep-link navigation wiring for shared map points.
**Summary:** Implemented `io.mqnavigation://meet` deep-link support with a dedicated `/meet` route, app-level incoming deep-link handling, and campus map long-press sharing. Added meet-point preselection in `MapPage`/`MapController` so incoming shared coordinates open directly as a destination and immediately trigger route loading.
**Files Changed:** `pubspec.yaml`, `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, `lib/app/mq_navigation_app.dart`, `lib/app/router/app_router.dart`, `lib/app/router/route_names.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/controllers/map_controller.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/pages/map_page.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/campus/campus_map_view.dart`.
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 144 tests, gen-l10n).

### Raouf: 2026-04-23 (AEST) — Dark/Light parity audit pass (Home + Settings)
**Scope:** Visual parity verification for dark mode and light mode branches.
**Summary:** Performed a full parity audit across `HomePage` and `SettingsPage` surface/background/accent usage. Confirmed shared scaffold backgrounds (`alabaster` light / `charcoal850` dark), matching dark-mode radial glow treatment, and consistent card token usage (`sand200`/`white-13%` borders, `charcoal850` dark surfaces). Fixed one remaining mismatch by aligning Home section-header light accent from `brightRed` to `red` so it matches Settings headers exactly. Also corrected stale Home documentation comment to reflect that the background photo now renders in both theme modes.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/home_page.dart`.
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 144 tests, gen-l10n).

### Raouf: 2026-04-23 (AEST) — Home bento hero swap + Settings kinetic/tactile refresh
**Scope:** Home quick-access hierarchy update and Settings interaction polish.
**Summary:** Updated Home Bento hierarchy so the large left hero card now routes to `Student Services` (query: `services`) and moved `Food & Drink` to the secondary quick row. Refreshed Settings with kinetic section/title animation, tactile row interactions via `MqTactileButton`, and a standout Danger Zone Bento block for wipe-data action while preserving existing controller wiring and i18n keys.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/home_page.dart`, `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`.
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 144 tests, gen-l10n).

### Raouf: 2026-04-23 (AEST) — Home background image dark-mode + clarity fix
**Scope:** Home background image rendering and visual clarity.
**Summary:** Fixed Home background photo visibility in dark mode by always rendering the campus background layer (instead of conditionally hiding it in dark mode). Reduced the background wash/veil opacity to avoid the “blurry/foggy” look: light overlay changed to `MqColors.alabaster` alpha `0.50` (from `0.78`) and dark overlay uses `MqColors.charcoal950` alpha `0.42` to preserve readability while keeping image detail visible.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/home_page.dart`.
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 144 tests, gen-l10n).

### Raouf: 2026-04-23 (AEST) — Home tactical UI refresh (tactile + kinetic + bento)
**Scope:** Home UX enhancement with tactile interactions and asymmetric quick access layout.
**Summary:** Added reusable `MqTactileButton` (`lib/shared/widgets/mq_tactile_button.dart`) with press-scale animation, drop-shadow depth, and configurable haptic feedback. Upgraded home hero text to a kinetic intro using `TweenAnimationBuilder` (fade + slide-up). Replaced the old symmetric quick-access grid with an asymmetrical Bento layout (hero card + stacked compact cards), while preserving tokenized styling and localized labels. Wired haptic preference from `SettingsController` into all home tactile cards.
**Files Changed:** `lib/shared/widgets/mq_tactile_button.dart`, `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/home_page.dart`.
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 144 tests, gen-l10n).

### Raouf: 2026-04-23 (AEST) — Settings/Home background parity
**Scope:** Visual consistency in Settings scaffold background.
**Summary:** Updated `SettingsPage` scaffold background to exactly match `HomePage` base colors in both theme modes (`MqColors.alabaster` in light mode and `MqColors.charcoal850` in dark mode), so both tabs now share identical page-level background surfaces.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`.
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 144 tests, gen-l10n).

### Raouf: 2026-04-23 (AEST) — Settings Audit & Functional Wiring
**Scope:** Verify all 12 settings are fully functional, persisted, and accurately consumed app-wide.
**Summary:** Conducted a comprehensive audit of `SettingsRepository`, `SettingsController`, and all app-wide consumers. Verified that `themeMode`, `localeCode`, `notificationsEnabled`, `lowDataMode`, `reducedMotion`, `quietHoursEnabled`, `quietHoursStart`, `quietHoursEnd`, and `highContrastMap` were perfectly wired. Fixed two functional bugs: 
1) `MapController` was using `ref.watch(settingsControllerProvider.future)` in its `build()` method, causing the entire map state (selected building, route, search query) to reset whenever *any* unrelated setting (e.g., theme or haptics) was toggled. Swapped to `ref.read` for initial load and `ref.listen` to selectively update `renderer` and `travelMode` dynamically.
2) `hapticsEnabled` was cosmetic (only used in the dev Easter egg). Wired it up to `MqHaptics.light` on all `SettingsPage` toggles/pickers and `MqHaptics.selection` in `BuildingSearchSheet`.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/map/presentation/controllers/map_controller.dart`, `lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/settings_page.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/building_search_sheet.dart`.
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 144 tests, gen-l10n).

### Raouf: 2026-04-23 (AEST) — Home/Settings 100% theme & colour parity
**Scope:** UI polish — locking `HomePage` to the same design language as `SettingsPage`.
**Summary:** Rewrote `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/home_page.dart` so every surface, border, text and accent colour mirrors `SettingsPage`: dual-theme branching via `context.isDarkMode`, charcoal850/white cards with `sand200` / `white-13%` borders, `vividRed` (dark) / `red` (light) accents, the Settings-style uppercase letter-spaced red section header, and the Settings red radial glow layered on dark-mode Home. Removed all hardcoded strings (i18n rule) by adding 11 `home_*` ARB keys to `app_en.arb` and propagating them with English fallback to all 34 non-English locales. Swapped `EdgeInsets` for `EdgeInsetsDirectional` for RTL safety.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/home/presentation/pages/home_page.dart`, `lib/app/l10n/app_en.arb`, `lib/app/l10n/app_*.arb` (34 locales), `lib/app/l10n/generated/*` (regenerated).
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed (format, analyze, 144 tests, gen-l10n).

### Summary

The project was built through phases 0–5, originally including auth, calendar, event feed, profile management, and gamification features. These were subsequently removed to focus the Flutter app on campus navigation: 3-tab nav (Home/Map/Settings), local-only settings, FCM push + study prompt notifications, and dual-renderer campus map with building search and routing via Edge Function proxy.

### Raouf: 2026-04-22 (AEST) — iOS deployment target synchronization & build fixes
**Scope:** iOS build configuration.
**Summary:** Updated IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET from 13.0 to 17.0 in `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`, `ios/Podfile`, and `ios/Flutter/AppFrameworkInfo.plist` (added `MinimumOSVersion`) to resolve version conflicts with Firebase 12.12.0+ and fix a compilation error in `connectivity_plus` (^7.0.0) which requires the iOS 17 SDK for `isUltraConstrained`. Synchronized `ios/Podfile.lock` via `pod update`. Added warning suppressions for third-party pods to ensure clean CI logs.
**Files Changed:** `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`, `ios/Podfile`, `ios/Podfile.lock`, `ios/Flutter/AppFrameworkInfo.plist`
**Verification:** `pod update` successful; ready for CI retry.

### Raouf: 2026-04-22 (AEST) — Zero-data features (Haptics, Quiet Hours, High-Contrast)

**Scope:** Maintenance.
**Summary:** Performed final cleanup: added `build/` to `.gitignore`, applied project-wide formatting via `dart format .`, and synchronized generated CMake files for Linux and Windows after dependency updates. Deleted temporary synchronization scripts.
**Files Changed:** `.gitignore`, `lib/**`, `linux/flutter/generated_plugins.cmake`, `windows/flutter/generated_plugins.cmake`
**Verification:** `git status` shows a clean working tree (excluding gitignored files).

### Raouf: 2026-04-22 (AEST) — Localization synchronization
**Scope:** Internationalization.
**Summary:** Synchronized 34 localization files (`app_*.arb`) with the master `app_en.arb`. Ensured all languages have the same set of keys, including the newly added settings and accessibility strings. Used English as the fallback value for missing translations to prevent UI breakage and "missing key" warnings during generation.
**Files Changed:** All `.arb` files in `lib/app/l10n/`.
**Verification:** `flutter gen-l10n` reported 0 untranslated messages.
**Scope:** Quality assurance & build stability.
**Summary:** Executed `scripts/check.sh` and resolved all issues. Added missing localization keys to `app_en.arb`. Fixed a Kotlin compilation error in `android/app/build.gradle.kts` by adding missing imports. Updated `MapController` tests to correctly mock the new `SettingsController` dependency, eliminating binding and storage errors during testing. Verified that all checks (format, analyze, test, build) now pass cleanly.
**Files Changed:** `lib/app/l10n/app_en.arb`, `android/app/build.gradle.kts`, `test/features/map/map_controller_test.dart`
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh` passed with 6/6 steps successful.

### Raouf: 2026-04-22 (AEST) — macOS deployment target synchronization
**Scope:** macOS build configuration.
**Summary:** Updated MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET from 11.0 to 13.0 in `macos/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` (both build settings and shell script phases) to align with Podfile and resolve plugin compilation errors (specifically for `app_links`).
**Files Changed:** `macos/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
**Verification:** Synchronized with Podfile and run.sh; ready for build retry.

### Raouf: 2026-04-22 (AEST) — Environment setup
**Scope:** `.env` creation.
**Summary:** Created a `.env` file from `.env.example` template with placeholders for Supabase and Google Maps credentials. This enables usage of `scripts/run.sh` and proper environment configuration.
**Files Changed:** `.env` (new, gitignored)
**Verification:** File exists and matches `.env.example` structure.

### Raouf: 2026-04-22 (AEST) — Run script robustness & parsing fix
**Scope:** `scripts/run.sh` logic improvement.
**Summary:** Refined argument parsing to distinguish between device targets and Flutter flags. Added quote stripping for API keys from `.env` to prevent JS/native syntax errors. Optimized `gradle.properties` modification to be idempotent. Added early `flutter` command check and switched `echo` to `printf` for safe variable handling.
**Files Changed:** `scripts/run.sh`
**Verification:** `bash -n scripts/run.sh` passed.

### Raouf: 2026-05-06 (AEST) — Google map camera control overlap fix + audit
**Scope:** Google map renderer UI chrome and production-readiness audit.
**Summary:** Moved Google Maps web camera controls above the custom find-my-location button by setting the web camera control to the right-center position; Google bottom positions only account for Google-owned chrome, so right-center avoids collision with Flutter overlay buttons reliably. Hardened the current-location camera sync path to use explicit locate zoom instead of a lat/lng-only camera update, keeping behavior consistent with the locate button. During the audit, replaced remaining Google/desktop route marker and polyline hardcoded colors with MQ semantic tokens.
**Files Changed:** `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/google/google_map_view.dart`, `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/google/desktop_map_fallback_view.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `/opt/homebrew/share/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin/dart format ...` passed; `/opt/homebrew/share/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin/dart analyze lib/features/map test/features/map` passed with no issues; `git diff --check` passed. Flutter test runner was blocked by sandbox-denied writes to `/opt/homebrew/share/flutter/bin/cache` (`engine.stamp`/`lockfile`); plain `dart test test/features/map` was attempted but is not valid for Flutter tests because `dart:ui` is unavailable outside the Flutter test runner.
**Follow-ups:** Run `flutter test test/features/map` or `./scripts/check.sh --quick` outside the restricted sandbox to re-confirm the full Flutter test suite.

### Raouf: 2026-04-28 (AEST) — System-wide documentation and logic synchronization
**Scope:** Project-wide documentation audit and map-renderer coordinate alignment.
**Summary:** Synchronized all project documentation (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`) with the actual 2026 state of the codebase. Updated test counts to reflect the full 154-test suite and corrected the Google Maps SDK version to 2.15. Aligned `GoogleMapView` initial coordinates with the official campus fallback used in `MapController` for visual consistency across renderers. Removed stale feature references (carousel/stats) from `README.md` and added the Metro Countdown card to the feature list.
**Files Changed:** `README.md`, `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/google/google_map_view.dart`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` → **5/5 passed** (analyze, 154 tests, gen-l10n). Verified `google_maps_flutter` 2026 standards compliance (zIndexInt, mapId).
**Follow-ups:** None.

### Raouf: 2026-04-28 (AEST) — Total Documentation Overhaul & Logic Sync
**Scope:** Repository-wide documentation rewrite and security audit.
**Summary:** Conducted a comprehensive audit and rewrite of `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and authored a new `SECURITY_POSTURE.md` (OWASP 2026). Synchronised all documentation with the functional 154-test suite and verified features (Metro Countdown), removing roadmapped or decorative claims from the live feature list.
**Files Changed:** `README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/SECURITY_POSTURE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
**Verification:** `./scripts/check.sh --quick` passed; manual verification of 2026 library standards via Context7.

### Raouf: 2026-04-28 (AEST) — Final Project-Wide Documentation Audit
**Scope:** Exhaustive audit of all repository documentation and inventory files.
**Summary:** Verified 13/13 documentation and inventory files for 100% accuracy against the current 154-test codebase. Confirmed that `endpoint_inventory.md`, `entity_inventory.md`, `env_inventory.md`, `key_inventory.md`, `map_inventory.md`, `notification_matrix.md`, `route_matrix.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and `TECHNICAL_EXPLANATION.md` are fully synchronised with the 2026 standards and functional logic. No further updates required.
**Files Audited:** All `.md` files in root and `docs/`.
**Verification:** Manual verification of each inventory field against source code and Context7 tech standards.
**Follow-ups:** None.
