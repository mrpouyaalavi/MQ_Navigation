# Map Dependency Inventory

All map-related APIs, services, keys, and data sources used by the campus map subsystem.

## API Keys

| Key | Location | Usage | Flutter Approach |
|-----|----------|-------|-----------------|
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` (client) | `--dart-define` / hardcoded debug fallback | Maps SDK rendering + Directions API | Restricted to app bundle ID in production |

## External Services

| Service | Web Usage | Flutter Usage |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Google Maps JavaScript API | Leaflet + GM JS API | google_maps_flutter (native SDK on Android/iOS, JS API on web) |
| Google Directions API | Via Next.js API proxy | Direct HTTP call from client (`google_routes_remote_source.dart`) |

> **Note:** Routing was migrated from the Supabase `maps-routes` edge function to a direct
> Google Directions API HTTP call. The edge function is kept in `supabase/functions/maps-routes/`
> but is no longer used by the Flutter app.

## Building Registry

- **Source**: `features/map/lib/buildings.ts` in web app (153 buildings in the current Flutter asset snapshot)
- **Fields per building**: id, name, position, description, tags, aliases, translationKey, descriptionKey, gridRef, address, category, location (lat/lng), entranceLocation, accessibilityEntranceLocation, googlePlaceId, levels, wheelchair
- **Categories**: academic, services, health, food, sports, venue, research, residential, other
- **Flutter storage**: Bundled JSON asset at `assets/data/buildings.json`

## Map Configuration

| Config | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Campus center lat | -33.7738 | Default camera target |
| Campus center lng | 151.1130 | Default camera target |
| Default zoom | 15.5 | |

> Camera bounds and min/max zoom restrictions were removed so users can freely
> pan and zoom outside the campus when navigating to/from off-campus locations.
