# Endpoint Inventory — API Routes → Flutter Mapping

Maps web API routes to their Flutter equivalents. After auth/calendar/feed removal, the Flutter app primarily uses the Maps & Notifications endpoints.

**Legend:**
- **SDK** = Call directly from Flutter via supabase_flutter (no server proxy needed)
- **EF** = Requires a Supabase Edge Function (server-side logic or secret keys)
- **N/A** = Not used by the Flutter app (web-only)

## Maps & Navigation (Used by Flutter)

| Web Route | Method | Flutter Approach | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| `/api/maps/routes` | POST | **Direct HTTP**: Google Directions API | Client-side call via `google_routes_remote_source.dart` |

> Routing was migrated from the `maps-routes` edge function to a direct
> Google Directions API HTTP call.  The edge function still exists in
> `supabase/functions/maps-routes/` but is unused by the Flutter client.

## Notifications (Used by Flutter)

| Web Route | Method | Flutter Approach | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| `/api/notifications` | GET | SDK: `supabase.from('notifications')` | Inbox read/query |
| `/api/notifications` | POST | EF: `notify` | Stores inbox row + dispatches push |
| `/api/notifications/[id]` | GET/PUT/DELETE | SDK: direct table ops | |
| `/api/notifications/mark-all-read` | POST | SDK: `supabase.from('notifications').update({read: true})` | |

## Web-Only Endpoints (Not Used by Flutter)

The following endpoints exist in the web app but are not used by the Flutter app after auth, calendar, feed, and profile features were removed:

| Category | Web Routes | Reason Not Used |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Auth | `/api/auth/*` (signin, signup, signout, password, email, mfa, passkey) | Auth removed from Flutter |
| Content | `/api/units`, `/api/deadlines`, `/api/events`, `/api/todos` | Calendar/content features removed |
| Profiles | `/api/profiles`, `/api/user-preferences` | Profile management removed |
| Gamification | `/api/gamification/*` | Gamification not implemented |
| Places | `/api/maps/place-search`, `/api/maps/place-details` | Not used by current map |
| Weather | `/api/weather` | Not used by current map |
| Security | `/api/security/*`, `/api/audit` | Web-only security tools |
| Sync | `/api/sync` | Realtime not used in current scope |

## Edge Functions (in this repo)

| Edge Function | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `maps-routes` | Google Routes API proxy (unused by Flutter — kept for web) |
| `notify` | FCM push notification dispatcher |
| `cleanup-cron` | Rate-limit record cleanup |

Web-only functions (`auth-email`, `auth-cleanup`, `routes-proxy`, `places-proxy`, `weather-proxy`, `security-utils`) were removed from this repo.
