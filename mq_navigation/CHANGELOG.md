**Scope:** Strip the entire feed feature and feed tab.

**Summary:**
Deleted `features/feed/` (6 files: repository, controller, page, filter bar, event card, feed item entity). Removed feed branch from router, feed tab from bottom nav (4 → 3 tabs), and `feed` route name.

**Files deleted:**

**Summary:**
Deleted the calendar module (4 files), academic models, dashboard repository/controller, and related tests. Simplified home page to a welcome card. Removed calendar tab from bottom nav (5 → 4 tabs). Removed `/calendar` and all `/detail/*` academic routes. Simplified notification scheduler to study-prompt-only. Removed "add to calendar" from feed.

**Files deleted:**
- `lib/features/calendar/**` (4 files)

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Fix zone mismatch in bootstrap

**Scope:** Move `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` inside `runZonedGuarded` so it shares the same zone as `runApp()`.

**Summary:**
`ensureInitialized()` was called in the root zone while `runApp()` was called inside `runZonedGuarded()`. Flutter requires both in the same zone. Moved binding initialization inside the guarded zone.

**Files changed:**
- `lib/app/bootstrap/bootstrap.dart`

**Verification:**
- `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 88/88 passed

**Follow-ups:**
- None

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Remove all auth/login code

**Scope:** Strip login, signup, auth guards, biometric lock, profile management, and auth provider from the project.

**Summary:**
Removed the entire authentication and profile system. Deleted `features/auth/` (11 files), `features/profiles/` (3 files), `route_guard.dart`, `auth_provider.dart`, `biometric_service.dart`, and `user_profile.dart`. Removed `local_auth` dependency from pubspec. Rewrote router to start at `/home` with no auth redirect. Refactored settings from Supabase-backed to local-only storage.

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Fix dart:io Platform crash on web

**Scope:** Replace all `dart:io` `Platform.*` calls with web-safe alternatives.

**Summary:**
Four files used `dart:io`'s `Platform.isAndroid` / `Platform.isIOS` which throws `Unsupported operation: Platform._operatingSystem` when running on web (Chrome). Replaced all occurrences with `kIsWeb` guard + `defaultTargetPlatform` from `package:flutter/foundation.dart`. No `dart:io` imports remain anywhere in `lib/`.

**Files changed:**
- `lib/app/bootstrap/bootstrap.dart` — Firebase init guard
- `lib/features/notifications/data/datasources/fcm_service.dart` — `_isSupported` and platform-specific permission/token logic
- `lib/features/notifications/data/datasources/local_notifications_service.dart` — `_isSupported`
- `lib/features/map/data/datasources/location_source.dart` — `_isSupported`

**Verification:**
- `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 99/99 passed
- Web build + launch no longer crashes

**Follow-ups:**
- None

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Fix Scripts + ARB + Run Configuration

**Scope:** Fix run.sh, add missing .env.example, propagate 13 missing ARB keys to all 34 locales.

**Summary:**
Rewrote `scripts/run.sh` to use Flutter's built-in `--dart-define-from-file` flag instead of manually parsing `.env` with shell IFS splitting. Created `.env.example` with placeholder keys so fresh clones have a setup template (the `.gitignore` already preserves it via `!.env.example`). Added 13 missing localization keys to all 34 non-English ARB files — these were added to `app_en.arb` during Phase 4/5 but never propagated, causing untranslated-message warnings on every build.

**Files changed:**
- `scripts/run.sh` — rewritten to use `--dart-define-from-file`
- `.env.example` — created with placeholder keys
- 34 ARB locale files — added `examReminders`, `systemAlerts`, `locationServicesDisabled`, `locationPermissionBlocked`, `locationPermissionRequired`, `locationUnsupported`, `locationUnavailable`, `dailyAt`, `deadlineLabel`, `studyPromptLabel`, `starts`, `ends`, `itemNoLongerAvailable`

**Verification:**
- `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 99/99 passed
- `flutter gen-l10n` → 0 untranslated warnings
- `scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 passed

**Follow-ups:**
- None

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Documentation Sweep: Stale References Cleanup

**Scope:** Read all project `.md` docs and fix stale directory names, outdated test counts, and completed-status labels.

**Summary:**
Updated `README.md` to use `mq_navigation` directory name (was `mq-navigation_flutter`) and corrected the CI test count from 78 to 99. Updated `Flutter_Migration_Plan.md` to use `mq_navigation` directory name in the description, clone instructions, and repo links. Updated `endpoint_inventory.md` section header from "Edge Functions to Build" to "Edge Functions (Deployed)" since all 9 functions are implemented.

**Files changed:**
- `README.md` — directory path in clone instructions, test count in CI/CD section
- `Flutter_Migration_Plan.md` — description, clone instructions, repo link
- `endpoint_inventory.md` — section header

**Verification:**
- All 16 project docs reviewed — no remaining stale references in active content
- Historical AGENT.md/CHANGELOG.md entries preserved as-is

**Follow-ups:**
- None

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Plan Alignment Audit + Final Old-Name Cleanup

**Scope:** Verify full project alignment with the updated Flutter Migration Plan and eliminate the last old-name reference.

**Summary:**
Audited the entire codebase against the user's updated migration plan. Confirmed all navigation-focused goals (interactive map, building registry, directions, category filtering) are fully implemented and the project exceeds the plan's scope with completed auth, calendar, dashboard, notifications, and feed features. Fixed the critical Android Kotlin directory mismatch: `MainActivity.kt` was still at `io/syllabussync/syllabus_sync/` with the old package declaration while `build.gradle.kts` used `io.mqnavigation.mq_navigation` — moved to the correct directory path and updated the package declaration. Updated `Flutter_Migration_Plan.md` to remove stale external `syllabus-sync` URLs. Verified zero old-name references remain in source/config files.

**Files changed:**
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/io/mqnavigation/mq_navigation/MainActivity.kt` — created at correct path with `package io.mqnavigation.mq_navigation`
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/io/syllabussync/` — deleted (old directory tree)
- `Flutter_Migration_Plan.md` — removed stale syllabus-sync external URLs

**Verification:**
- `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 99/99 passed
- Zero remaining old-name references in source/config files (historical changelog entries preserved)

**Follow-ups:**
- None — naming is fully consistent across the entire codebase

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Full Project Rename: Syllabus Sync → MQ Navigation

**Scope:** Rename every reference across the entire codebase from "Syllabus Sync" to "MQ Navigation".

**Summary:**
Renamed all name variants across the full project: Dart package name (`syllabus_sync` → `mq_navigation`), main app class (`SyllabusSyncApp` → `MqNavigationApp`), Android/iOS bundle identifiers (`io.syllabussync.*` → `io.mqnavigation.*`), URL schemes (`io.syllabussync://` → `io.mqnavigation://`), display name in all 35 ARB locale files, UI hardcoded strings, Edge Function email subjects, documentation, and platform config files. Renamed the main app file from `syllabus_sync_app.dart` to `mq_navigation_app.dart`. Regenerated Flutter l10n. Preserved external URLs pointing to the web app's GitHub repo and Vercel deployment. Renamed the project folder from `syllabus-sync_flutter` to `mq_navigation`.

**Files changed:**
- 300+ files across all categories:
  - All Dart source and test files (`package:syllabus_sync/` → `package:mq_navigation/`)
  - `lib/app/syllabus_sync_app.dart` → `lib/app/mq_navigation_app.dart` (file rename)
  - `pubspec.yaml` — package name
  - `android/app/build.gradle.kts` — namespace + applicationId
  - `android/fastlane/Appfile` — package name
  - `ios/Runner/Info.plist` — bundle name, URL scheme, usage descriptions
  - `ios/fastlane/Appfile` — app identifier
  - `supabase/config.toml` — project ID, redirect URIs
  - `supabase/functions/auth-email/index.ts` — email subject lines
  - 35 ARB locale files — display name references
  - All `.md` documentation files
  - Platform configs: `CMakeLists.txt`, `manifest.json`, `index.html`, `.xcscheme`, `.pbxproj`, `.xcconfig`, `Runner.rc`, `.cc`, `.cpp`

**Verification:**
- `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 99/99 passed
- Zero remaining old-name references in source/config files (only external web app URLs preserved)

**Follow-ups:**
- Commit and push
- If the sibling web app folder is also renamed, update `tools/convert_i18n.dart` path

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Updated Migration Plan Document

**Scope:** Create a comprehensive Flutter Migration Plan document reflecting the actual completed state of all phases 0–5.

**Summary:**
Built a full migration plan document (`Flutter_Migration_Plan.md`) aligned with the user's provided template format. The document covers the current state of both the web and mobile apps, the two-frontends-one-backend architecture, the complete tech stack with pinned dependencies, full project structure with feature-first clean architecture, navigation and route maps with cascading auth guards, detailed feature breakdown with Pouya/Raouf ownership across all 5 implementation phases, the 9-function Edge Functions inventory, i18n details (35 ARB locales with RTL support), the security model, environment configuration for both client and server, CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions + Fastlane), testing summary (99 tests across 15 files), team contributions, external deployment prerequisites, and how-to-run instructions.

**Files created:**
- `Flutter_Migration_Plan.md`

**Verification:**
- `flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos` → 0 issues
- `flutter test` → 99/99 passed

**Follow-ups:**
- Commit and push the migration plan document

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Final Stage Verification + Release Handoff

**Scope:** Close verification for the last Phase 4/5 patch and document what remains outside the repo.

**Summary:**
Verified the completed Phase 4/5 implementation after the final native Firebase, localization, and typed map-error patch. Android now builds cleanly with conditional Google Services activation, iOS safely configures Firebase only when the service plist exists, notification/detail UI strings resolve through ARB-backed localization, and the map page now routes failures through typed `MapStateError` values instead of English sentinel strings. The only remaining gaps are external deployment prerequisites: real `android/app/google-services.json`, real `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`, APNs/FCM console setup, Google Cloud key restrictions, Supabase Edge Function secrets, and deployment of `notify` / `maps-routes`.

**Files changed:**
- `AGENT.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

**Verification:**
- `flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos` → no issues
- `flutter test` → 99/99 passed
- `./scripts/check.sh` → 6/6 checks passed, including debug APK build
- `deno check supabase/functions/maps-routes/index.ts` → passed
- `deno check supabase/functions/notify/index.ts` → passed
- `deno check supabase/functions/cleanup-cron/index.ts` → passed

**Follow-ups:**
- Commit and push the completed Phase 4/5 repo state to `origin/main`
- Apply Firebase, Supabase, and Google Cloud secrets/configuration in the target environments

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Phase 4 + Phase 5 Runtime Stabilization

**Scope:** Resolve the first client runtime gaps found after the initial feed/notifications/map implementation pass.

**Summary:**
Normalized notification preferences so partially populated `notification_preferences` rows no longer break toggle updates, hardened notification/map JSON parsing and route-coordinate validation, and fixed feed pagination ordering so cursor-based pagination remains stable instead of reordering featured items ahead of the cursor. Added concrete `/detail/deadline/:deadlineId`, `/detail/exam/:examId`, and `/detail/event/:eventId` routes plus repository-backed academic item detail pages so notification deep links now land on real Flutter screens rather than unresolved paths. Also removed the last map analyze warning and replaced a small set of hardcoded map action labels with existing localized strings.

**Files changed:**
- `lib/features/notifications/domain/entities/notification_preferences.dart`
- `lib/features/notifications/data/datasources/notification_remote_source.dart`
- `lib/features/notifications/domain/entities/app_notification.dart`
- `lib/features/feed/data/repositories/feed_repository.dart`
- `lib/features/map/domain/entities/building.dart`
- `lib/features/map/data/datasources/google_routes_remote_source.dart`
- `lib/features/map/presentation/pages/map_page.dart`
- `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/campus_map_view.dart`
- `lib/features/map/presentation/widgets/route_panel.dart`
- `lib/features/calendar/data/repositories/calendar_repository.dart`
- `lib/features/calendar/presentation/pages/academic_item_detail_page.dart`
- `lib/app/router/app_router.dart`

**Verification:**
- Pending final analyze/test pass after the server functions, docs, and tests are added in this same implementation cycle.

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Phase 4 + Phase 5 Edge Functions

**Scope:** Add the Supabase server-side implementation required by the new Flutter notification and map flows.

**Summary:**
Added a dedicated `maps-routes` Edge Function for the Flutter map stack with authenticated Google Routes proxying, strict request validation, and per-user `rate_limits` throttling at 60 requests per minute. Added a new `notify` Edge Function that validates the caller, writes the inbox record to `notifications`, dispatches push notifications through Firebase using server-side credentials, and removes stale `user_fcm_tokens` on push failures. Also corrected the existing cleanup cron so rate-limit cleanup now targets the documented `reset_time_ms` column instead of the stale `window_end` name, and registered both new functions in `supabase/config.toml`.

**Files changed:**
- `supabase/functions/maps-routes/index.ts`
- `supabase/functions/notify/index.ts`
- `supabase/functions/cleanup-cron/index.ts`
- `supabase/config.toml`

**Verification:**
- Pending final repo-wide verification after the Phase 4/5 tests and documentation updates are completed.

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Edge Function TypeScript Cleanup

**Scope:** Correct the first-pass TypeScript issues in the new `notify` function before verification.

**Summary:**
Replaced invalid Dart-style array helpers in `supabase/functions/notify/index.ts` with standard TypeScript collection methods, made FCM v1 response parsing tolerant of non-JSON upstream error bodies, and tightened the remaining equality check so the new push dispatcher can be formatted and validated cleanly.

**Files changed:**
- `supabase/functions/notify/index.ts`

**Verification:**
- Pending function formatting and the final repo-wide verification pass.

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Phase 5 Registry + Regression Tests

**Scope:** Replace the temporary map asset with the audited web registry and add regression coverage for the new Phase 4/5 behavior.

**Summary:**
Regenerated `assets/data/buildings.json` from the sibling web app's `features/map/lib/buildings.ts` source so Flutter now bundles the full 153-building campus registry instead of a temporary sample list. The generated asset preserves the six audited `entranceLocation` and `googlePlaceId` enrichments and fills missing marker coordinates from the calibrated pixel map data so the MVP map can render the whole campus. Added targeted tests for notification preference normalization and stable reminder scheduling, feed-import event persistence through `source_public_event_id`, map route parsing, `/notifications` route constants, and an asset-level guard that fails if the bundled building registry drops below full campus scale.

**Files changed:**
- `assets/data/buildings.json`
- `test/app/route_names_test.dart`
- `test/features/home/academic_models_test.dart`
- `test/features/notifications/notification_scheduler_test.dart`
- `test/features/map/map_route_test.dart`
- `test/features/map/building_registry_asset_test.dart`

**Verification:**
- Pending final repo-wide analyze/test/check pass after the documentation updates are completed.

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Phase 4 + Phase 5 Documentation Alignment

**Scope:** Bring the repository documentation and inventories in line with the implemented notifications, feed, and map stack.

**Summary:**
Updated the README with the delivered Phase 4/5 scope, the required mobile Firebase/Maps setup steps, and the Edge Function secret inventory for `notify` and `maps-routes`. Expanded `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` with concrete subsystem notes for notifications/feed/map, corrected `env_inventory.md` to match the removed client-side Maps key fallback and the preferred Firebase service-account secret, and refreshed the endpoint, notification, map, and route inventories so they describe the implemented `/notifications`, `/detail/...`, `notify`, and `maps-routes` flows rather than the older placeholders. Also updated the stale `EnvConfig` test that still expected a committed debug Google Maps key fallback.

**Files changed:**
- `README.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `env_inventory.md`
- `endpoint_inventory.md`
- `notification_matrix.md`
- `map_inventory.md`
- `route_matrix.md`
- `test/core/env_config_test.dart`

**Verification:**
- Pending the final analyze/test/check pass.

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Phase 4 + Phase 5 Final Verification

**Scope:** Close the implementation cycle with repo-wide validation.

**Summary:**
Verified the completed Phase 4/5 pass end-to-end. `flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos` returned 0 issues, `flutter test` passed 99/99 tests including the new notification/map regressions and building-registry asset guard, `scripts/check.sh --quick` passed all 5 checks, and `deno check` succeeded for `supabase/functions/maps-routes`, `supabase/functions/notify`, and `supabase/functions/cleanup-cron`.

**Files changed:**
- `AGENT.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

**Verification:**
- Complete.

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Final Stage Gap Closure

**Scope:** Finish the remaining concrete Phase 4/5 implementation gaps before commit.

**Summary:**
Added the missing native Firebase activation hooks so Android now auto-applies the Google Services plugin when `android/app/google-services.json` exists and iOS now configures Firebase automatically when `GoogleService-Info.plist` is present. Replaced the remaining hardcoded notification/detail strings with ARB-backed localization usage, and replaced map error sentinel strings with a typed `MapStateError` flow so the map UI no longer relies on English string comparisons for routing or location failures.

**Files changed:**
- `android/settings.gradle.kts`
- `android/app/build.gradle.kts`
- `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`
- `lib/app/l10n/app_en.arb`
- `lib/features/notifications/presentation/widgets/notification_tile.dart`
- `lib/features/notifications/presentation/pages/notifications_page.dart`
- `lib/features/calendar/presentation/pages/academic_item_detail_page.dart`
- `lib/features/map/presentation/controllers/map_controller.dart`
- `lib/features/map/presentation/pages/map_page.dart`
- `README.md`

**Verification:**
- Pending final analyze/test/build pass for this closing patch.

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Phase 4 + Phase 5 Implementation

**Scope:** Notifications foundation, feed implementation, map MVP implementation, mobile notification/bootstrap wiring, and native map SDK setup for the Phase 4/5 implementation pass.

**Summary:**
Added the first production notification slice: Firebase bootstrap registration, Android/iOS mobile notification permission hooks, local notification channels and scheduling services, Supabase-backed notification inbox/preferences data sources, a Riverpod notifications controller, and the `/notifications` route/page. Also resolved the first integration issues found by `flutter analyze` (`FirebaseMessaging` bootstrap import, the required `uiLocalNotificationDateInterpretation` scheduling parameter, and the feed query `DateTimeRange` import), replaced the placeholder feed screen with a Supabase-backed events/announcements feed plus filter/search/pagination and calendar-import wiring, replaced the placeholder map screen with a repository/controller/widget stack covering building registry loading, building search, location permission handling, Google Maps rendering, routing, and `/map/building/:id` deep links, and removed the committed Dart Google Maps dev key so the implementation depends on explicit client build configuration rather than a source-controlled key.

**Files changed:**
- `pubspec.yaml`
- `lib/core/config/env_config.dart`
- `lib/app/bootstrap/bootstrap.dart`
- `lib/app/mq_navigation_app.dart`

- `android/app/build.gradle.kts`
- `ios/Runner/Info.plist`
- `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`
- `assets/data/buildings.json`

**Verification:**
- Pending until the edge functions, tests, docs, and full check suite are complete in this same pass.

**Follow-ups:**
- Add the `notify` and `maps-routes` Supabase Edge Functions
- Document the required native Firebase service files and APNs setup
- Run `flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, and `scripts/check.sh --quick`

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Phase 0 Gap Closure: Edge Functions + Fastlane

**Scope:** Close the two remaining Phase 0 blueprint gaps — Supabase Edge Functions scaffold and Fastlane distribution config — identified during a full Phases 0–3 audit.

**Summary:**
Created the complete Supabase Edge Functions scaffold with 7 production-ready Deno functions matching the endpoint inventory: `auth-email` (Resend-based email verification send/resend/verify), `auth-cleanup` (expired password-reset and email-verification token cleanup), `routes-proxy` (Google Routes API proxy keeping billing key server-side), `places-proxy` (Google Places API search and detail proxy), `weather-proxy` (Google Weather API proxy for campus conditions), `security-utils` (Have I Been Pwned k-anonymity password breach check), and `cleanup-cron` (rate-limit and audit-log retention cleanup). All functions include shared CORS headers, structured error handling, and cron-secret verification where applicable.

Created Fastlane configs for both platforms: Android lanes (`build_debug`, `build_release`, `deploy_internal`, `promote_beta`) and iOS lanes (`build_debug`, `build_release`, `deploy_testflight`, `promote_appstore`), both with `--dart-define` environment variable injection for Supabase and Google Maps keys.

- `ios/fastlane/Fastfile` — iOS build and deploy lanes

**Verification:**
- `flutter analyze` → No issues found
- `flutter test` → 94/94 tests passed
- `scripts/check.sh --quick` → 5/5 checks passed

**Follow-ups:**

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Remove Unrelated MQ_Navigation Tree

**Scope:** Clean the parent repository so `mq-navigation_flutter` remains the sole active Flutter application after the earlier history merge.

**Summary:**
Removed the unrelated `MQ_Navigation` directory from the repository root and restored the root documentation to point back to `mq-navigation_flutter` as the primary mobile app. No application logic inside `mq-navigation_flutter` was changed in this cleanup.

**Files changed:**
- Parent repo `README.md` — restored project paths to `mq-navigation_flutter`
- Parent repo git tree — removed `MQ_Navigation/**`

**Verification:**
- Root repository tree confirms `mq-navigation_flutter` is the only remaining Flutter app directory

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Context7 Audit Hardening for Phase 2 + Phase 3

**Scope:** Re-audit the completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 migration slices against current Flutter, go_router, and Supabase docs fetched via Context7, then correct any concrete deviations.

**Summary:**
Confirmed that the project’s core 2026 patterns are still correct: `MaterialApp.router`, `ErrorWidget.builder`, async `go_router` redirects, `refreshListenable`, and Supabase `onAuthStateChange` usage match current guidance. Tightened the implementation in the places where the audit found real runtime risks.

Auth routing now handles upstream Supabase failures safely by logging and falling back instead of throwing from the router redirect. Email verification refresh now guards the no-session state so the action does not fail before the verification deep link completes. Google OAuth sign-in now reports browser-launch failures instead of silently acting like the flow started. Biometric unlock now recovers when biometric support disappears after the preference was enabled by bypassing the lock for the session and turning the setting off. Calendar timeline state also now excludes undated or out-of-range to-dos and events from agenda/day/week views, and anonymous users now leave `/splash` for `/login` once auth loading completes.

**Files changed:**
- `lib/app/router/app_router.dart` — wrapped async MFA/profile guard reads with safe error handling
- `lib/app/router/route_guard.dart` — corrected post-loading anonymous redirect behavior from splash
- `lib/features/auth/data/repositories/auth_repository.dart` — surfaced Google OAuth launch failure as an app exception
- `lib/features/auth/presentation/controllers/auth_flow_controller.dart` — returned app exception messages to the UI
- `lib/features/auth/presentation/pages/verify_email_page.dart` — guarded verification refresh when no session exists yet
- `lib/features/auth/presentation/widgets/biometric_lock_gate.dart` — handled unsupported biometrics without leaving the app stuck behind the lock overlay
- `lib/features/calendar/presentation/controllers/calendar_controller.dart` — constrained timeline entries to the focused week
- `lib/shared/models/academic_models.dart` — excluded undated to-dos from `CalendarEntry` timelines
- `test/app/route_guard_test.dart` — added anonymous splash redirect coverage
- `test/features/auth/auth_flow_controller_test.dart` — added Google OAuth launch failure coverage
- `test/features/calendar/calendar_state_test.dart` — added undated/out-of-range to-do timeline coverage

### Raouf: 2026-03-11 (AEDT) — Phase 2 + Phase 3 Delivery

**Scope:** Implement the migration blueprint’s mobile auth/profile/settings stack and home/calendar core inside the Flutter client.

**Summary:**
Replaced the placeholder Phase 2 experience with production-backed routes and screens for login, signup, email verification, password reset, MFA challenge/enrollment, onboarding, profile editing, and settings management. Added Supabase-backed repositories and Riverpod controllers for auth, profile, user preferences, and MFA state. Wired app-level theme, locale, and biometric lock behavior into `MaterialApp.router` and routing guards.

Replaced the placeholder Phase 3 experience with a repository-backed dashboard and calendar. Added shared academic models for units, deadlines, events, todos, gamification, dashboard stress metrics, and calendar entries.

### Raouf: 2026-03-10 (AEDT) — Context7 Docs Compliance Fixes

**Scope:** Compare codebase against latest 2026 Flutter/Riverpod/GoRouter/Supabase/local_auth docs via Context7; fix deviations.

**Summary:**
Fetched latest documentation for Flutter, Riverpod 3, GoRouter 17, Supabase Flutter, and local_auth 3 via Context7 MCP. Compared all patterns against our code. Found 3 deviations from the Flutter error handling docs: missing `PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError` (Layer 2 error catcher), missing `ErrorWidget.builder` customisation in MaterialApp, and missing `FlutterError.presentError` call for debug console output. All other patterns (ColorScheme.fromSeed, NavigationBar, AsyncNotifier, ref.listen/read/watch, refreshListenable, StatefulShellRoute, PKCE auth, onAuthStateChange, biometric API) confirmed correct.

**Files changed:**
- `lib/core/error/error_boundary.dart` — Added `PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError` (Layer 2) + `FlutterError.presentError` call
- `lib/app/mq_navigation_app.dart` — Added `MaterialApp.builder` with custom `ErrorWidget.builder`

**Verification:**
- `flutter analyze` -> No issues found
- `flutter test` -> 78/78 tests passed
- 12/12 patterns confirmed matching latest 2026 docs
