# Contributing to MQ Navigation Flutter

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. This document outlines the workflow and standards expected for all contributions.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork & clone** the repository.
2. Install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (stable channel, SDK ^3.11.0).
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
4. Copy the environment template and fill in your keys:

```bash
flutter run \
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co \
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key \
  --dart-define=APP_ENV=development
```

## Development Workflow

### Branch naming

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Feature | `feature/<short-description>` | `feature/auth-mfa-flow` |
| Bug fix | `fix/<short-description>` | `fix/login-redirect-loop` |
| Chore | `chore/<short-description>` | `chore/update-deps` |

### Before submitting a PR

Run the full check suite:

```bash
./scripts/check.sh --quick
```

This executes:
- `flutter pub get` -- dependency resolution
- `dart format --set-exit-if-changed lib/ test/ tools/` -- format check
- `flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos` -- static analysis
- `flutter test` -- all unit and widget tests
- `flutter gen-l10n` -- localisation generation

All checks must pass before a PR will be reviewed.

### Commit messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add building detail photo gallery
fix: resolve map marker tap on RTL locales
chore: pin intl dependency to ^0.20.2
test: add widget tests for MqInput validation
```

## Architecture Rules

- **Feature-first**: each feature lives in `lib/features/<name>/` with `data/`, `domain/`, and `presentation/` layers.
- **State management**: use Riverpod providers exclusively. No `setState`, no Bloc.
- **Routing**: use `go_router` named routes via `RouteNames` constants.
- **Design tokens**: use `MqColors`, `MqTypography`, `MqSpacing` -- no magic numbers or hardcoded colors.
- **Accessibility**: all interactive elements must have semantic labels and meet the 48dp minimum tap target.
- **RTL support**: use `EdgeInsetsDirectional` and `TextDirection`-aware layouts.

## Code Style

- Follow the rules in `analysis_options.yaml`.
- Prefer `const` constructors where possible.
- Prefer `final` local variables.
- Prefer single quotes for strings.
- Run `dart format .` before committing.

## Localisation

- Source strings live in `lib/app/l10n/app_en.arb`.
- Run `dart tools/convert_i18n.dart` to regenerate ARB files from the web app's JSON.
- Never hardcode user-visible strings -- always use `AppLocalizations`.

## Testing

- Every new widget should have at least one `testWidgets` test.
- Every new domain entity should have `fromJson`/`toJson` round-trip tests.
- Every new provider should have unit tests covering its state transitions.
- Test files mirror the `lib/` directory structure under `test/`.
