# Architecture Overview

This document describes the technical architecture of the MQ Navigation Flutter mobile app.

## System Context

MQ Navigation uses a **two frontends, one backend** architecture:

```
+------------------+     +------------------+
|  Flutter Mobile  |     |  Next.js Web App  |
|  (this repo)     |     |  (mq-navigation)  |
+--------+---------+     +--------+---------+
         |                         |
         +--------+    +-----------+
                  |    |
            +-----v----v-----+
            |    Supabase     |
            |  (Auth, DB,     |
            |   RLS, Realtime,|
            |   Edge Fns)     |
            +-----------------+
```

Both clients share the same Supabase backend. The Flutter app is a **presentation-layer-only** client --- no server logic runs in the app binary.

    home/
      presentation/pages/home_page.dart
    map/
      data/datasources/
      data/repositories/
      domain/entities/
      domain/services/
      presentation/controllers/
      presentation/pages/

      presentation/pages/
      presentation/widgets/
    settings/
      data/repositories/
      presentation/controllers/
      presentation/pages/
```

## Feature Module Pattern

Each feature follows a three-layer structure:

```
features/<name>/
  data/           # Data sources (Supabase, local cache) + repository implementations
  domain/         # Entities, value objects, repository interfaces, use cases
  presentation/   # Pages, widgets, Riverpod controllers/providers
```

**Rules:**
- Features never import from another feature's `data/` or `domain/` layer directly
- Cross-feature communication happens through `shared/providers/`
- Only `presentation/` widgets may use `BuildContext`

## Subsystems

### Notifications

- `features/notifications/` owns FCM token sync, local study prompt scheduling, the notification inbox, and preference state.
- FCM tokens are stored in `user_fcm_tokens` and refreshed on token rotation.
- `supabase/functions/notify` stores the inbox row in `notifications` and dispatches push delivery through Firebase without exposing push credentials to Flutter.
- Local notifications are limited to study prompt reminders scheduled via `flutter_local_notifications`.

### Campus Map

- `features/map/` loads the building registry from the bundled JSON asset (153 buildings from the audited web registry).
- The 6 high-traffic buildings carry explicit `entranceLocation` and `googlePlaceId` enrichments for routing parity.
- The map now uses a shared controller state with two renderer targets: `flutter_map` for campus mode and `google_maps_flutter` for Google mode.
- `MapRendererType` decides how the map is drawn; search, selected building, route state, travel mode, and location state stay shared.
- The campus renderer now consumes the exported web raster image (`assets/maps/mq-campus.png`) plus shared overlay metadata, calibrated GPS projection coefficients, and pixel-space building coordinates.
- Both renderers route through the `maps-routes` Supabase Edge Function, which normalizes Google Routes and campus walking responses into the same `MapRoute` contract.
- Client-side location uses `geolocator`, with renderer-specific drawing handled by `GoogleMapView` and `CampusMapView`.

## State Management

**Riverpod** (v3.2.1) is the sole state management solution.

| Provider Type | Use Case |
|--------------|----------|
| `Provider` | Singletons (router, services) |
| `AsyncNotifierProvider` | Map state, data fetching with lifecycle |
| `StreamProvider` | Real-time data (connectivity) |
| `FutureProvider` | One-shot async data loading |

**No `setState`, no Bloc, no ChangeNotifier.**

## Routing

**GoRouter** (v17.1.0) with:
- `StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack` for the 3-tab bottom navigation (Home, Map, Settings)
- `/notifications` as a standalone route pushed on top of the shell
- `/map/building/:buildingId` for deep-linking to a specific building
- Named routes via `RouteNames` constants
- App starts at `/home` with no auth guards

## Design System

The MQ Design System maps Macquarie University's web CSS tokens to Flutter:

| Token | Source | Flutter |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Colors | `mq-tokens.css` | `MqColors` |
| Typography | Work Sans + Source Serif Pro | `MqTypography` |
| Spacing | 4px base scale | `MqSpacing` |
| Radii | `radius-sm/md/lg` | `MqSpacing.radius*` |

Both **light** and **dark** themes are built from these tokens via `MqTheme.light` and `MqTheme.dark`.

## Localisation

- 35 locales, converted from the web app's JSON files to Flutter ARB format
- RTL support for Arabic, Farsi, Hebrew, and Urdu
- ICU message syntax (`{variable}`) with Dart reserved word prefixing (`class` -> `kClass`)
- Conversion tool: `dart tools/convert_i18n.dart`

## Security Model

1. **No server secrets in client** --- API keys stay in Edge Functions
2. **Encrypted storage** --- `flutter_secure_storage` (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore)
3. **RLS enforcement** --- all database access governed by Supabase Row-Level Security

## Environment Configuration

Build-time injection via `--dart-define`:

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Yes | Supabase project URL |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Yes | Supabase anonymous API key |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | No | Google Maps SDK key for the embedded map |
| `APP_ENV` | No | `development` / `staging` / `production` |

`EnvConfig.validate()` throws `StateError` in release builds if required vars are missing.
Debug builds still fall back to committed Supabase development values, but the
Google Maps client key must be supplied locally and is not committed to the repo.

## CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

```
Push/PR to main
  -> Analyze & Test (ubuntu)
     -> format check
     -> flutter analyze
     -> flutter test --coverage
     -> deno check maps-routes/maps-places

Pull request only
  -> Build Android Smoke (ubuntu)
     -> flutter build apk --debug

Push to main only
  -> Build Android (ubuntu, Java 17)
     -> flutter build apk --release
     -> Upload artifact
  -> Build iOS (macos)
     -> flutter build ios --release --no-codesign
```

## Error Handling

- **Sealed exceptions** (`AppException`): `NetworkException`, `AuthException`, `ServerException`, `StorageException`, `UnsupportedException`
- **Result type**: `Result<T>` sealed class with `Success<T>` and `Failure<T>`
- **Error boundary**: `ErrorBoundary` widget wrapping the app tree, showing a friendly fallback UI instead of the red screen
- **Zone guard**: `runZonedGuarded` in `bootstrap()` catches unhandled async errors
- **Structured logging**: `AppLogger` wrapping the `logger` package

## Testing Strategy

| Layer | Tool | Location |
|-------|------|----------|
| Unit tests | `flutter_test` | `test/core/`, `test/features/` |
| Widget tests | `flutter_test` | `test/shared/`, `test/app/` |

Quality gate: `scripts/check.sh` runs format, analyze, test, and gen-l10n in sequence.
