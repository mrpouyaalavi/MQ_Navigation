/// Versioned cache key. **Bump the suffix whenever `buildings.json`
/// changes shape (new tags, new aliases, schema changes)** — every
/// install will invalidate its previous cache on next launch and
/// re-hydrate from the bundled asset. The previous unversioned key
/// (`'building_registry'`) is intentionally never re-used so installs
/// upgrading from older builds never serve stale enrichment data.
///
/// Version history:
///   v2 — Open Day 2026 release: `faculty`, `campus hub`, and
///        `student services` tags, plus 66 cross-departmental aliases
///        and the Gale History Museum entry.
///   v3 — Campus tour script enrichment: aliases + searchTokens for
///        Service Connect, IT Service Desk, Learning Connect, Career
///        and Employment Service (18WW); Michael Kirby Building, Law
///        Commons, Moot Courts (17WW); Arts Precinct, Faculty of Arts
///        Offices, A/B/C aliases (25BWW); The Hub, student group
///        stalls (1CC); Lincoln Building, Research Office (16WW);
///        15-17 Gymnasium Road on Student Accommodation; Macquarie
///        Theatre under Campus Hub. Three duplicate sub-building
///        entries removed (17WWMICHAE, 18WWSERVIC, 16WWLINCOL).
///   v4 — Campus tour script pages 4–8: dual-address 14SCO ↔ 12WW;
///        Muslim Prayer Rooms, Macquarie International, MQ University
///        College, Numeracy Centre, Emergency Blue Help Point, Mason
///        Theatre on 14SCO; Walanga Muru Pavilion / Jannawi context
///        on WALU; Australian Hearing Hub + Student Wellbeing +
///        Accessibility + Counselling + Welfare on 16UA; Ainsworth /
///        Clinical Education on AINS; Frank the Bear on 6WW; T1 +
///        theatres on LOTUS and 29WW; MUSAC + sport-and-aquatic
///        aliases on SPORT; Macquarie University History Museum on
///        GALEHIST; Macquarie University Village on MQV; 2SER 107.3
///        on CHAP (10 Hadenfeld); Campus Security Office on LIB;
///        2 Technology Place on CLINIC; Biological Sciences Museum
///        aliases on BIODISC and 6SR; parking-on-campus tokens on
///        every parking entry. Four duplicate stubs removed (27WW,
///        16UAAUSTRA, 25CWW, 1WW).
///   v5 — Category browse refresh: introduces `facultyGroup` per
///        faculty building (4 groups: arts / business / mhhs /
///        science_engineering) to power the two-level Faculty
///        drill-down. Cleaner Student Services + Campus Hub labels
///        (Service Connect / IT / Learning Support; Lincoln Building;
///        Counselling & Wellbeing; The Hub / Student Life; etc.).
///        Removed duplicate stubs 16MW (folded into LIB) and 6SR
///        (folded into BIODISC). Demoted 6WW and 16WW from the
///        Campus Hub bucket — they're primarily Faculty/Research
///        buildings, not student-life destinations. 11WW labelled as
///        Tutorial Rooms; LOTUS labelled as T1 Lecture Theatre.
